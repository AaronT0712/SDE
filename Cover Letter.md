Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the **Software Engineer** position at Regrello. With a strong foundation in computer science and extensive hands-on experience in software development and system optimization, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your innovative team. I am particularly interested in opportunities in **Seattle or the Bay Area**, but I am **open to relocating to other locations without assistance**.

Currently, as a Master's candidate in Information Science at Cornell University, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including Java, Python, and C++, and have gained a deep understanding of frameworks and tools such as Spring Boot, Kafka, and Redis. My academic journey, coupled with a first-class honors degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering from the University of Liverpool, has provided me with a robust theoretical and practical background. I have maintained a GPA of **3.8** throughout both my undergraduate and graduate studies.

During my recent internship at NextTier, I developed and optimized distributed systems based on a legacy user system using Spring Boot, MySQL, and Redis, significantly improving system performance and reliability. I implemented custom caching strategies and concurrency control mechanisms that reduced API response times and ensured data integrity across distributed environments. Similarly, at Eth Technology, I designed a high-throughput microservice utilizing Kafka and Spring Boot, successfully managing thousands of events simultaneously and automating testing processes for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

One of my notable projects, AaronFlow, exemplifies my capability to design scalable and efficient software solutions. This asynchronous task processing framework, built with Spring Boot and Redis, showcases my expertise in optimizing performance and ensuring robust task management through innovative use of database technologies and distributed locking mechanisms.

I am particularly drawn to Regrello because of your commitment to leveraging advanced technologies to solve real-world problems. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my technical skills and innovative mindset in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to developing solutions that have a tangible impact. **I am available to start full-time in January 2025** and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for technology to Regrello and am confident that my background in software development and system optimization aligns well with your needs.

Sincerely,
Yuhan Tan
