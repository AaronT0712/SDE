#### 介绍一下

-- 这个项目里，我开发了一个OCJS。你知道，We **do lots** of coding problems on the LeetCode or simliar website  when **finding a job**. But one day, I am curious about, how Leetcode works? What happened after I click "Submit Bottom." Does it hava mulitple IDEs to run the user's code?  So I decided to find it out.
-- The core of this project I think is the **code sandbox**. So I still used Java and Spring Boot to develop backend system and MySQL as database. And use Vue3 and Arco Design to finish the basic front-end development. 
-- In this project, I used two ways to implement code sandbox. The first is, using Java's **Runtime** function, to execute the code via **command-line operation** and get feedback, But it was not safe.
Then, I decided to put this process into the **docker** for higher security cuz the **image** is isolated. 
-- Moreover, I tried several ways to improve the security. Like using **JVM parameter** to limit memory usage、A **thread** to stop the timeout task、Using **Trie to limit the code**、Using **Java Security Manager** to limit the **permission**.

#### 具体作用

-- Arco Design: A framework that has lots of **existing code** for different components, copy and alter a little bit so that we can use.
-- RabbitMQ 而不是 Kafka: Kafka is best for High ThrougPut, RabbitMQ is faster and easy to use. I can just read document to use it.
