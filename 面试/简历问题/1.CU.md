#### 1. Tell me about this

-- During this Experience, I am responsible for the **grading HW**, answering questions about **R**, **Machine Learning** or environment setup, and hold **OH**.
-- I think we did great. Cuz we can see the improvement of socres for the HW, Project. And later in this course, there were less questions about HW and projects, which means they understood the course quite well.

#### 2. Personalized?

-- There were under-graduate studs, master studs, PhD **studs**, and in different **majors**, they had different skils. Some students may not know how to R, some students may know about ML but don't know API, model deployment.
-- So, before answering their questions, I should ask them about their ability to better understand their problems.
