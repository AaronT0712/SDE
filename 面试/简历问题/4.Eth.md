#### 1. 介绍一下

-- 在这个实习中，我学习了一些basic knowledge about SpringBoot, microservices, and Kafka. And got basic programming skills with the help of a senior engineer.
-- Then, I designed and developed **microservices** that produces shopping event for the consumers, using **Kafka** for steaming, and **H2** database for storing event's meta-data. (it is light and based on memory, best for **fast** storing / querying)
-- Also, I used several ways to perform the unit **test** (JUnit), integrated test (Embed Ka), and performance test (JMeter).
-- Eventually, the microservices can handle 1000+ events at one time. And the usage of RESTful APIs make it easy to integrated in the exising system.

#### 2. 一些概念

-- Kafka: I would say it is like a **streaming message queue**. It have producer, consumer. There are many **topics** in **Broker**, which assigned and stored events into partitions.
-- Microservice: I think it **separate** the **monolic** project into many **smaller, independent services / functions** so that developers can handle or develope  each service independently and (Connect them easily via API)
