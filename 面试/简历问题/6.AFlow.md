#### 介绍一下

AaronFlow is a Asynchronous Task Processing Framework. It provides the Task Monitoring, Automatic Retry, Priority and other **Non-Business** Ability. So that User only need to focus on implementing the actual business functions.

From the Architecture, it contains two layers, one is **Flowsvr**, which is responsible for task creation, pulling, setting status, etc. The other layer is **Aaron**, we can treat it as a "Worker layer" or the "Consumer", it would pull the tasks from the *Flowsvr* and then executes it.
