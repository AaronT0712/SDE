### 「与上级/同事产生分歧，最后达成一致并取得成果」（情境1）

​	•	**核心看点**：冲突 -> 坚持己见/寻求妥协 -> 行动过程 -> 最终结果/反思。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**（所有围绕“坚持、冲突、妥协”的题）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（你如何沟通、化解分歧，最终让对方相信你的想法）

​	•	**Are Right, A Lot**（如果过程中涉及到你如何做决策、判断，对错结果的复盘）

**Situation:**

During the Online Coding Judgement System project—you can image it as a very simplified version of LeetCode—I was responsible for the backend development while my teammate focused on the front end. As the project going, I've found several places to do the optimization, and I want to implement them. So I turned to my teammate for advice.

However, my teammate was concerned that these changes would delay our progress and add additional work, as she preferred a quick finish to showcase this project on her resume.

**Task:**
Because I really want to learn sth. from my project, but not just do coding, I need to convince her that these optimization was worth the extra effort, though it may delay the progress a little bit. 

**Action:**

1. **Open Discussion:**
   So, I had a conversation with my teammate to fully understand her concerns. She explained that a quick project completion was important for resume purposes because it is really hard to get a job or even an interview right now. And the time would be the key in this job market.
2. **Data-Driven Explanation:**
   Then, I shared several examples from my previous project, where the optimization would greatly improve the performance. Also, I expressed my view about the project, I want to make our system better, and closer to a real-world solution so that our work was meaningful.
3. **Proposing a Compromise:**
   To balance our priorities, I proposed we could only optimizing the part that would not greatly alter our design, which is decoupling the code judging process by using a message queue. After evaluation, we thought it was not that difficult and risk of failure was low; For the rest of optimization, We could finish them after.

**Result:**

After reaching an agreement, I quickly implemented the change. The optimization just took two more days, which didn't affect our progress too much. The decoupled judging process greatly improved the system performance. Both my teammate and I were very satisfied with this outcome. We didn't affect our plan too much, also we enhanced the system’s scalability.

有什么优化处：such as transforming the system into microservices, developed individual coding sandbox, decouple workflow.

原来的优化：Our initial design allowed the system to handle code submission, execution, and result retrieval in one flow. However, I identified an opportunity to significantly improve performance by decoupling the judging process using a message queue.
