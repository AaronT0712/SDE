**Situation:**
In our Online Coding Judgement System project—a collaborative effort between a teammate and me—I was responsible for the judging service while my teammate focused on the front end. Our initial design allowed the system to handle code submission, execution, and result retrieval in one flow. However, I identified an opportunity to significantly improve performance by decoupling the judging process using a message queue. My teammate was concerned that this change would delay our project and add unnecessary complexity, as she preferred a quick finish to showcase on our resumes.

**Task:**
My goal was to convince her that the performance optimization was worth the extra effort, without jeopardizing our timeline. I needed to address her concerns while demonstrating that this improvement would not only boost performance but also make our system more robust and closer to a real-world application.

**Action:**

1. **Open Discussion:**
   I initiated a conversation with my teammate to fully understand her concerns. She explained that a quick project completion was important for resume purposes and that a simple design would be easier to manage.
2. **Data-Driven Explanation:**
   I shared insights from my previous project (AaronFlow), where decoupling tasks significantly improved performance. I explained that decoupling—in this case by introducing a message queue—would help manage workloads more efficiently and enhance scalability, without needing a complete redesign of the system.
3. **Proposing a Compromise:**
   To balance our priorities, I proposed we only modify the judging part of the system. This way, we could introduce the message queue to improve performance while keeping other parts of the project intact, ensuring that the overall changes were minimal.
4. **Implementation:**
   After reaching a mutual agreement, I quickly implemented the change. The optimization took just an additional two days, and I ensured that the new design was well-integrated and did not disrupt our existing workflow.

**Result:**
The optimized judging service performed significantly better in our tests, with noticeable improvements in system performance. Both my teammate and I were very satisfied with the outcome. Not only did we deliver a working product on time, but we also enhanced the system’s scalability and real-world applicability. This experience reinforced the value of open communication, compromise, and standing by well-researched ideas.
