  **Situation:**

  During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team faced a significant disagreement about the scoring mechanism.

  ​	•	My colleague and I initially proposed a **simple scoring system** and we believed this approach would ensure a quick launch and validate the game’s feasibility.

  ​	•	However, other team members wanted to implement a **more complex scoring system**  to make the game more engaging. Moreover, they can **collect more diverse data** to perform data analysis.
  

  The disagreement was creating tension in the team and delaying progress.

  

  **Task:**

  As the **team lead**, I needed to **mediate the conflict** cuz the ignorance would lead to loss of involvement, and ensure we delivered a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on time while balancing the need for technical feasibility and user engagement.

  

  **Action:**

  ​	1.	**Clarified the Project Timeline:**

  ​	•	I reviewed the Gantt Chart and timeline with our project manager and confirmed that introducing a more complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.

  ​	2.	**Made a Team Discussion:**

  ​	•	We organized a meeting to ensure everyone had a chance to share their opinions and concerns.

  ​	•	And I actively listened to both sides, recognizing the importance of timely delivery while acknowledging the value of enhancing gameplay for users.

  ​	3.	**Proposed a Balanced Solution:**

  ​	•	I suggested starting with the **simple scoring system** for the initial release to meet the deadline. To address the concerns of the other team members, I proposed designing the code with extensibility. Using **object-oriented principles and the Observer pattern**, we created a flexible architecture that could support advanced scoring features—like difficulty-based bonuses and combo multipliers—in future updates.

  ​	4.	**Validated the Decision with User Feedback:**

  ​	•	To ensure we weren’t making assumptions, We made a small user survey to gather feedback on their preferences so that we won't waste our time on the necessary part.

  

  **Result:**

  ​	•	**Timely Launch:** We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game on schedule but left room for future update

  ​	•	**Positive Feedback:** We got client's positive feedback about the smooth gameplay and leaderboard functionality. The leaderboard became one of the game’s most popular features.

  ​	•	**Foundation for Future Updates:** The flexible architecture allowed us to easily introduce advanced scoring features in subsequent versions without significant redevelopment.

  ​	•	**Improved Team Collaboration:** This experience strengthened team trust and cohesion, as members saw that their concerns were heard and addressed.

  

  ——可选——

  **Reflection:**

  From this experience, I learned three key lessons:

  ​	1.	**Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing timely delivery ensured the success of the project despite initial disagreements.

  ​	2.	**Design for Flexibility:** Leaving room for future updates allowed us to balance short-term needs with long-term improvements.

  ​	3.	**Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback helped align the team and make confident decisions.
