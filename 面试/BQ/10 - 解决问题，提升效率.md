**Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for the team** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速，每次开发完数据库相关的功能就会慢)

**S**：During one of my internships as an SDE intern, we were working on building a partner matching platform base on a legacy user system. After completing the user query function, we wanted to simulate an environment with 10 million users to test the performance. However, the way they import data into the database really took a long time, which would definitely impact our development progress.
**T**：My job was to handle some of the backend development and optimize the system’s performance. So, I needed to resolve the slow data import issue to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck in our testing and further development.
**A**：First, I moved the data import functionality into the test package so that it could be easily invoked as needed. After reviewing the existing code for importing data, I noticed that it established too many database connections, which was time-consuming. Additionally, the data import was handled through a `for` loop, which is linear and may lead to blocking issues. To address this, I implemented concurrent batch insertion using custom thread pools and `CompletableFuture`, which allowing us to insert data in parallel.
**R**：The optimization was substantial—the data import speed increased by 6 times. This not only resolved the immediate pain point but also accelerated our development and testing phases.
