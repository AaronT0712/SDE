**Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for the team** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速，每次开发完数据库相关的功能就会慢)

**Situation:**
During my internship as an SDE intern, we were building a partner matching platform based on a user system. We had successfully completed the user query function at that time, and begin to test the system’s performance. To do so, we needed to simulate an environment with 1M users. However, the existing data import process provided by the software was extremely slow and took nearly 5 minutes.

**Task:**
 Since we frequently needed to manipulate database for testing and development, this inefficiency process became a major bottleneck. And I took the initiative to optimize the data import process

**Action:**

+ I investigated the built-in function and found that it inserted records sequentially, leading to poor performance because of Transaction Overhead and Connection Overhead. So I decided to implement by my own. 
+ To improve efficiency, I used **batch insertion**, which greatly reduced the import time by 2 times. However, I realized that if any batch insertion takes too long or fail, it could block the following insertions because for-loop.

- To address this, I then decided to use multi-threads to do batch insertion. The idea was to process multiple batches concurrently, reducing the risk of bottlenecks.
- While this improved performance, it didn't fully meet my expectations. After checking the logs, I found that not all the threads were working and the default thread pool configuration was limiting concurrency. I then optimized it by using a **custom thread pool** to ensure all threads could perform the insertion correctly.

**Result:**
The optimization improve the data import time from 300s to 50s. This improvement not only resolved the immediate bottleneck but also accelerated the future development and testing workflow. Moreover, this success has made me even more eager to solve problems to improve efficiency.
