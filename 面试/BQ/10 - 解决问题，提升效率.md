**Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for the team** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速，每次开发完数据库相关的功能就会慢)

**Situation:**
During my internship as an SDE intern, we were building a partner matching platform based on a user system. We had successfully completed the user query function, and to test the system’s performance, we needed to simulate an environment with 10 million users. However, the existing data import process provided by the software was extremely slow. Considering that we would frequently repeat this process in the future, this could become a major bottleneck and hinder our development progress.

**Task:**
As a member of the backend team, I wanted to o optimize the data import process to ensure it wouldn't slow down our testing or future development. So, I am focused on looking into this problem, figuring out a better practice, and  them implemented this solutions that allow to quickly import data. 



**Action:**

- **Refactoring for Reusability:** I moved the data import functionality into the test package, which made it easier to invoke the import process when needed.

- Code Review & Analysis:

   I reviewed the existing import code and noticed two main issues:

  1. The code was establishing too many database connections, which slowed down the process.
  2. The import was performed using a simple `for` loop, which processed data linearly and could block other operations.

- **Implementing a Parallel Approach:** To address these issues, I implemented concurrent batch insertion using custom thread pools along with `CompletableFuture`. This allowed multiple batches of data to be inserted in parallel, rather than sequentially.

**Result:**
The optimization resulted in a sixfold increase in data import speed. This substantial improvement not only resolved the immediate bottleneck but also accelerated our overall development and testing phases, making it easier for the team to simulate large datasets efficiently.
