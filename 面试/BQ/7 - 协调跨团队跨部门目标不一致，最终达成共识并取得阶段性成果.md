**Situation:**
During the development of our **Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team had a conflict regarding the scoring mechanism. The data team was pushing for a **complex scoring system** to make the game more engaging and to get more diverse data for advanced analysis, while I preferred a **simple scoring system** to ensure a quick launch, because I am the only one developer for this part and I was afraid to fail to meet the timeline. This conflict was creating tension and delaying our progress at first.

**Task:**
Because we only have two developers and we didn't want disagreement to hinder our progress, We need to resolve the conflict and guide the team toward an agreement, that balances technical feasibility with data requirement. And I needed to ensure that we can deliver a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on time without compromising on quality.

**Action:**

1. **Clarified the Project Timeline:**
   - I reviewed our Gantt chart and overall timeline with the project manager, confirming that implementing a complex scoring system require few days and risk missing our deadline.
2. **Facilitated Open Discussion:**
   - Then I organized a quick meeting to allow everyone to share their opinions and concerns. I actively listened to the data team, recognizing their desire to perform advanced analysis and enhance gameplay while emphasizing the importance of a timely launch.
3. **Proposed a Balanced Solution:**
   - To ensure we met our deadline, I proposed implementing a simple scoring for the initial release. At the same time, I applied OO Design and the some design pattern, so that it is easier to introduce new features(—such as difficulty-based bonuses—in the future) to meet their requirement.
4. **Validated with User Feedback:**
   - To ensure our product aligned with user preferences, while I was working on initial launch, the data team can conduct a brief user survey about the gameplay at the same time. This data-driven step can help to clarify the advanced mechanism and support fast implementation in the future since a clear plan would decrease the communication cost.

**Result:**

- **Timely Launch:** As a result, We successfully launched the game with smooth gameplay on schedule, while leaving room for future enhancements. 
- **Foundation for Future Updates:** And the advanced features designed according to the survey was quickly implemented, because the data team setup a clear plan and also we held regular meeting to make sure we're on the same page.
- **Improved Team Collaboration:** I think, this experience strengthened trust and cohesion within the team, as all members saw that their concerns were heard and respected.

**Reflection:**
This experience taught me three key lessons:

1. **Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing a timely, high-quality launch is critical—even when team opinions diverge.
2. **Design for Flexibility:** Building extensible systems from the outset enables future enhancements without major overhauls.
3. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback can validate our approach and help align divergent team goals.

**Situation:**

During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team faced a significant disagreement about the scoring mechanism.

​	•	The data team wanted to implement a **more complex scoring system**  to make the game more engaging. Moreover, they can **collect more diverse data** to perform data analysis.

​	•	However, I insist in using a **simple scoring system** and I believed this approach would ensure a quick launch and validate the game’s feasibility.


The disagreement was creating tension in the team and delaying progress.



**Task:**

As the **team lead**, I needed to **mediate the conflict** cuz the ignorance would lead to loss of involvement, and ensure we delivered a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on time while balancing the need for technical feasibility and user engagement.



**Action:**

​	1.	**Clarified the Project Timeline:**

​	•	I reviewed the Gantt Chart and timeline with our project manager and confirmed that introducing a more complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.

​	2.	**Made a Team Discussion:**

​	•	We organized a meeting to ensure everyone had a chance to share their opinions and concerns.

​	•	And I actively listened to both sides, recognizing the importance of timely delivery while acknowledging the value of enhancing gameplay for users.

​	3.	**Proposed a Balanced Solution:**

​	•	I suggested starting with the **simple scoring system** for the initial release to meet the deadline. To address the concerns of the other team members, I proposed designing the code with extensibility. Using **object-oriented principles and the Observer pattern**, we created a flexible architecture that could support advanced scoring features—like difficulty-based bonuses and combo multipliers—in future updates.

​	4.	**Validated the Decision with User Feedback:**

​	•	To ensure we weren’t making assumptions, We made a small user survey to gather feedback on their preferences so that we won't waste our time on the necessary part.



**Result:**

​	•	**Timely Launch:** We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game on schedule but left room for future update

​	•	**Positive Feedback:** We got client's positive feedback about the smooth gameplay and leaderboard functionality. The leaderboard became one of the game’s most popular features.

​	•	**Foundation for Future Updates:** The flexible architecture allowed us to easily introduce advanced scoring features in subsequent versions without significant redevelopment.

​	•	**Improved Team Collaboration:** This experience strengthened team trust and cohesion, as members saw that their concerns were heard and addressed.

**Reflection:**

From this experience, I learned three key lessons:

​	1.	**Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing timely delivery ensured the success of the project despite initial disagreements.

​	2.	**Design for Flexibility:** Leaving room for future updates allowed us to balance short-term needs with long-term improvements.

​	3.	**Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback helped align the team and make confident decisions.
