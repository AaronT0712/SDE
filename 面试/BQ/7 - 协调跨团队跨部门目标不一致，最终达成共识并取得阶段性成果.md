### **7「协调跨团队/跨部门目标不一致，最终达成共识并取得阶段性成果」**

​	•	**核心看点**：多方目标冲突 -> 沟通/谈判 -> 达成一致 -> 后续成果/教训。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Earn Trust**（和不同团队合作、对齐、互相信任的过程）

​	•	**Have Backbone**（如果中间经历过分歧，你坚守了什么，或怎样“Disagree and Commit”）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（最后如何保证项目如期完成）

**Situation:**
During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team encountered a significant conflict regarding the scoring mechanism. The data team was pushing for a **complex scoring system** to make the game more engaging and to capture richer data for analysis, while I advocated for a **simple scoring system** to ensure a quick launch and validate the game's feasibility. This disagreement was creating tension and delaying our progress.

**Task:**
As the team lead, my responsibility was to mediate the conflict and steer the team toward a consensus that balanced technical feasibility with enhanced user engagement. I needed to ensure that we delivered a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on time without compromising on quality or customer expectations.

**Action:**

1. **Clarified the Project Timeline:**
   - I reviewed our Gantt chart and overall timeline with the project manager, confirming that implementing a complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.
2. **Facilitated Open Discussion:**
   - I organized a team meeting to allow everyone to share their opinions and concerns. I actively listened to both sides, recognizing the importance of a timely launch while also understanding the data team's desire to enhance gameplay.
3. **Proposed a Balanced Solution:**
   - I proposed that we implement the **simple scoring system** for the initial release to meet our deadline. To address the concerns about future enhancements, I suggested designing the code with extensibility in mind. By leveraging object-oriented design principles and the Observer pattern, we built a flexible architecture capable of supporting advanced scoring features—such as difficulty-based bonuses and combo multipliers—in future updates.
4. **Validated with User Feedback:**
   - To ensure our approach was aligned with user preferences, we conducted a brief user survey. This data-driven step helped confirm that the simple system was sufficient for launch and that advanced features could be prioritized for later improvements.

**Result:**

- **Timely Launch:** We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game on schedule, leaving room for future enhancements.
- **Positive Feedback:** Our client and early users praised the smooth gameplay and robust leaderboard functionality, with the leaderboard quickly becoming one of the game's most popular features.
- **Foundation for Future Updates:** The flexible architecture we built allowed us to seamlessly integrate advanced scoring features in subsequent versions without significant redevelopment.
- **Improved Team Collaboration:** The process strengthened trust and cohesion within the team, as members saw that their concerns were heard and balanced against the project’s core objectives.

**Reflection:**
This experience taught me three key lessons:

1. **Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing a timely, high-quality launch is critical—even when team opinions diverge.
2. **Design for Flexibility:** Building extensible systems from the outset enables future enhancements without major overhauls.
3. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback can validate our approach and help align divergent team goals.

**Situation:**

During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team faced a significant disagreement about the scoring mechanism.

​	•	The data team wanted to implement a **more complex scoring system**  to make the game more engaging. Moreover, they can **collect more diverse data** to perform data analysis.

​	•	However, I insist in using a **simple scoring system** and I believed this approach would ensure a quick launch and validate the game’s feasibility.


The disagreement was creating tension in the team and delaying progress.



**Task:**

As the **team lead**, I needed to **mediate the conflict** cuz the ignorance would lead to loss of involvement, and ensure we delivered a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on time while balancing the need for technical feasibility and user engagement.



**Action:**

​	1.	**Clarified the Project Timeline:**

​	•	I reviewed the Gantt Chart and timeline with our project manager and confirmed that introducing a more complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.

​	2.	**Made a Team Discussion:**

​	•	We organized a meeting to ensure everyone had a chance to share their opinions and concerns.

​	•	And I actively listened to both sides, recognizing the importance of timely delivery while acknowledging the value of enhancing gameplay for users.

​	3.	**Proposed a Balanced Solution:**

​	•	I suggested starting with the **simple scoring system** for the initial release to meet the deadline. To address the concerns of the other team members, I proposed designing the code with extensibility. Using **object-oriented principles and the Observer pattern**, we created a flexible architecture that could support advanced scoring features—like difficulty-based bonuses and combo multipliers—in future updates.

​	4.	**Validated the Decision with User Feedback:**

​	•	To ensure we weren’t making assumptions, We made a small user survey to gather feedback on their preferences so that we won't waste our time on the necessary part.



**Result:**

​	•	**Timely Launch:** We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game on schedule but left room for future update

​	•	**Positive Feedback:** We got client's positive feedback about the smooth gameplay and leaderboard functionality. The leaderboard became one of the game’s most popular features.

​	•	**Foundation for Future Updates:** The flexible architecture allowed us to easily introduce advanced scoring features in subsequent versions without significant redevelopment.

​	•	**Improved Team Collaboration:** This experience strengthened team trust and cohesion, as members saw that their concerns were heard and addressed.

**Reflection:**

From this experience, I learned three key lessons:

​	1.	**Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing timely delivery ensured the success of the project despite initial disagreements.

​	2.	**Design for Flexibility:** Leaving room for future updates allowed us to balance short-term needs with long-term improvements.

​	3.	**Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback helped align the team and make confident decisions.
