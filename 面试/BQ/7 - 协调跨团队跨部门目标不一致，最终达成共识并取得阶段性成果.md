**「协调跨团队/跨部门目标不一致，最终达成共识并取得阶段性成果」**

​	•	**核心看点**：多方目标冲突 -> 沟通/谈判 -> 达成一致 -> 后续成果/教训。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Earn Trust**（和不同团队合作、对齐、互相信任的过程）

​	•	**Have Backbone**（如果中间经历过分歧，你坚守了什么，或怎样“Disagree and Commit”）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（最后如何保证项目如期完成）

​	•	**Customer Obsession**（如果此过程与客户需求或体验有直接关联）

**Situation:**

During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team faced a significant disagreement about the scoring mechanism.

​	•	The data team wanted to implement a **more complex scoring system**  to make the game more engaging. Moreover, they can **collect more diverse data** to perform data analysis.

​	•	However, I insist in using a **simple scoring system** and I believed this approach would ensure a quick launch and validate the game’s feasibility.


The disagreement was creating tension in the team and delaying progress.



**Task:**

As the **team lead**, I needed to **mediate the conflict** cuz the ignorance would lead to loss of involvement, and ensure we delivered a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on time while balancing the need for technical feasibility and user engagement.



**Action:**

​	1.	**Clarified the Project Timeline:**

​	•	I reviewed the Gantt Chart and timeline with our project manager and confirmed that introducing a more complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.

​	2.	**Made a Team Discussion:**

​	•	We organized a meeting to ensure everyone had a chance to share their opinions and concerns.

​	•	And I actively listened to both sides, recognizing the importance of timely delivery while acknowledging the value of enhancing gameplay for users.

​	3.	**Proposed a Balanced Solution:**

​	•	I suggested starting with the **simple scoring system** for the initial release to meet the deadline. To address the concerns of the other team members, I proposed designing the code with extensibility. Using **object-oriented principles and the Observer pattern**, we created a flexible architecture that could support advanced scoring features—like difficulty-based bonuses and combo multipliers—in future updates.

​	4.	**Validated the Decision with User Feedback:**

​	•	To ensure we weren’t making assumptions, We made a small user survey to gather feedback on their preferences so that we won't waste our time on the necessary part.



**Result:**

​	•	**Timely Launch:** We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game on schedule but left room for future update

​	•	**Positive Feedback:** We got client's positive feedback about the smooth gameplay and leaderboard functionality. The leaderboard became one of the game’s most popular features.

​	•	**Foundation for Future Updates:** The flexible architecture allowed us to easily introduce advanced scoring features in subsequent versions without significant redevelopment.

​	•	**Improved Team Collaboration:** This experience strengthened team trust and cohesion, as members saw that their concerns were heard and addressed.

**Reflection:**

From this experience, I learned three key lessons:

​	1.	**Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing timely delivery ensured the success of the project despite initial disagreements.

​	2.	**Design for Flexibility:** Leaving room for future updates allowed us to balance short-term needs with long-term improvements.

​	3.	**Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback helped align the team and make confident decisions.
