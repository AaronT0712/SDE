**Situation:**

During the Online Coding Judgement System project—you can image it as a very simplified version of LeetCode—I was responsible for the backend development while my teammate focused on the front end. As the project going, I've found several places to do the optimization, and I want to implement them. So I turned to my teammate for advice.

However, my teammate was concerned that these changes would add additional work and delay our progress , as she preferred a quick finish to showcase this project on her resume.

**Task:**
Because I really want to learn sth. from my project, but not just do coding, I need to convince her that these optimization was worth the extra effort, though it may delay the progress a little bit. 

**Action:**

1. **Open Discussion:**
   So, I had a conversation with my teammate to fully understand her concerns. She explained that a quick project completion was important for resume purposes because it is really hard to get a job or even an interview right now. And the time would be the key in this job market.
2. **Data-Driven Explanation:**
   Then,  I expressed my view about the project, I want to make our system better, and closer to a real-world solution so that our work was meaningful. Also, I shared several examples from my previous project, where the optimization would greatly improve the performance.
3. **Proposing a Compromise:**
   To balance our priorities, I proposed we could only optimizing the part that would not greatly alter our design, which is decoupling the code judging process by using a message queue. After evaluation, we thought it was not that difficult and risk of failure was low; For the rest of optimization, We could finish them after.

**Result:**

After reaching an agreement, I quickly implemented the change. The optimization just took two more days, which didn't affect our progress too much. The decoupled judging process greatly improved the system performance. Both my teammate and I were very satisfied with this outcome. We didn't affect our plan too much, also we enhanced the system’s scalability. 

-------

有什么优化处：such as transforming the system into microservices, developed individual coding sandbox, decouple workflow.

原来的优化：Our initial design allowed the system to handle code submission, execution, and result retrieval in one flow. However, I identified an opportunity to significantly improve performance by decoupling the judging process using a message queue.

**Situation:**

For my final year project, which was using machine learning to analyze 3D microscope images. By analyzed the distribution of protein, researchers can predict cell's life-cycle stage accordingly. At the beginning, I assumed that the core challenge was 3D image segmentation so I decided to work based on this. I built a complex solution that using 3D ML method to analyze while using several algorithms to make the dataset consistent. This solution works quite well from my side. And it was over half of the project timeline, so I decided to deploy it to lab's devices for testing.

However, I found that differences in lab devices led to dependency problems and many of them cannot run this solution. And most computers didn't have a GPU, so the whole solution run extremely slow and the result was not that ideal.

(用户体验：而且，我觉得现在的deployment was difficult for the researchers that don't have CS knowledge)

**Task:**
I quickly realized that 

​    (I failed to consider the real-world factors. It was not a coursework that under ideal situation, and now the computing resource was limited. I need to quickly adopt a new solution before the project completely fail.) 
​    (the computational resources were limited. Also, it seems that the dataset was not enough to perform a good training.) 
​    (the user experience was bad because of the difficult deployment and usage and long waiting time.)

So, my goal became to design a more resource-efficient ML workflow that could run quickly on various devices while still deliver accurate results within the given time.

**Action:**

1. **Deep Dive & Research:** Instead of rushing to work, I investigated of the available devices and the dataset in lab. Then I reviewed several literature and consulted professors with AI expertise to understand the trade-offs between less computational-heavy method with accuracy. 
2. **Resource-Conscious Redesign:** Considering the limited computing and training resource, I shifted my strategy from fully 3D method to a hybrid approach—using 2D analysis combined with metadata for restoration. This allowed for much faster processing, even on CPU, while still capturing essential spatial information. Also, this process allowed me to have more training data from the limited dataset.
3. (**Rapid Decision-Making & Automation:** Also, I streamlined the entire configuration process with script to make deployment as simple as possible across different computers and made simple user manual so that researchers can deploy and use them easily.)

**Result:**
The redesigned ML solution ran successfully on multiple lab computers and achieved accurate analysis in a short time. This project was delivered while the resources were limited. Moreover, this innovative approach  won the prize, and eventually led to a publication in BMC Biology, which is one of the top science journal.

**Situation:**
While working on a project for AMX, the clients were struggling with low accuracy with their models. Though their tried to improve the performance by retraining it with different parameters, the results didn't show significant improvement.

**Task:**
As one of the Engineers, my job was to determine why the accuracy remained low after training, and find out the root cause, then collaborate with my team to identify and implement a solution for clients.

**Action:**

1. To better understand client's problem, I hold a brief but focused meeting with them to walk through their entire process for retraining that model. During this meeting, I carefully record their workflow and potential areas of concern.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** After the meeting, I discussed the collected data with the team. Because we found that the training parameters and processes seems correct, we thought that the quality of datasets might be the underlying issue but not the training itself.
3. - **Validation Experiment:** To validate our idea, We made an experiment by retraining the model using a better dataset. This allowed us to examine our thought quickly without greatly delaying the project. And the result showed that dataset quality was the key factor in this issue. 
     Though we found the reason, we knew that building a new dataset with higher quality requires extra budget and time, and the clients may not pick this advice in a short time. We should find another solution for them.
   - **Immediate Enhancement:** Since the training was correct and the dataset should not be changed right now, we started with their model to find potential improvement. Because client's model was developed based on BERT's model, so we decided to optimize the BERT and then recommend this strategy to the clients as another solution, which was more cost-efficient.
4. **Communicate Findings:** After optimization, We then organized a follow-up meeting with the client to present our analysis and two solutions. We recommended clients modify their models first, and improve their dataset in the future.

**Result:**
The client accepted our proposal. They thought our solution really exceeded their expectation, cuz it not only resolved their immediate problem with less price, but also set the stage for better model performance in the future.

**Situation:**
It was the AaronFlow project and I finished most part of development. However, during stress testing with **wrk** (测flowsvr), I noticed that the performance wasn’t as high as expected and also, the CPU usage was highly unstable. After using commands and checking the performance manager, I found that there were sudden spikes in CPU load, indicating that something deeper was affecting the system.

**Task:**
Although I had already applied standard optimizations like adjusting MySQL connection pools, the problem still exist. I was curious about this issue and I decided to dive deep into this and identify the root cause that affecting CPU stability and performance.

**Action:**

1. **Data Gathering & Initial Hypothesis:**
   - I started by analyzing the server side, since the worker part(Aaron) processed tasks rapidly and its operation was light.
   - After reviewing system metrics and checking various forums about this situation, I thought the problem may occur during multi-computer competition. (API call一般很快，那基本问题出现在与DB的交互，这是经验) Then I look into the code for this part and identified the use of the **for-update** may be the potential problem.
2. **Deep Technical Analysis:**
   - After reading the inner workings of the **for-update** command, I discovered that it can generate **gap locks**. It may delay query execution and affect performance, which it is also not recommended in the book called *High Performance MySQL*.
   - I then focused on the unusual CPU spikes. Because the system showed that, the CPU load spike when servers tried to fetched tasks. This led me to dive deeper into the MySQL. I found that MySQL used an automatic deadlock detection that checks for dependencies between queries. As the number of concurrent tasks increased, this mechanism caused high load on the CPU.
3. **Implementing the Solution:**
   - To address both the gap-lock issue and the detection overhead, I dropped the lock produced by the MySQL and decided to implement by myself.
   - After reviewing multiple forums and articles about multi-computer competition, I introduced a **distributed locking mechanism** to better manage the consistency under competition. Also, to address CPU load, I introduced **randomized delays** in task invocations to spread out the load.

**Result:**
The adjustments led to a great performance improvement: CPU became stable under load, and the system throughput greatly increased. By diving deep into the problem of **for-update** and the deadlock detection, I not only solved the immediate performance issues but also gained valuable experience.

**Situation:**
In my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, my team was developing an AI-driven application that provided personalized cosmetic and makeup recommendations. Two days before our scheduled presentation, other professors expressed strong interest in our work, and our supervisor suggest we should have a more detailed presentation, but not just using paper.

**Task:**
Although the deadline was tight and our team only had four members, we couldn’t afford to let the professors down. So we must quickly design and build an interactive demo that showcased the features within the given time.

**Action:**

1. **Rapid Assessment and Decision-Making:**
   1.  We immediately held a meeting. We all agreed that an high-fidelity demo would make a great presentation, but the limited time and lack of skillsets made it difficult to build. So, we decided to make a simple interactive demo, which was much better than using paper and drawings, though it usually considered as a minimal deliverable, 
   2.  So we began exploring tools that could help us achieve this goal without coding under our tight DDL.

2. **Leveraging the Right Tool:**
   - After a brief search, we discovered Figma—a platform popular among UX designers for creating interactive prototypes—which also supports real-time collaboration, so that we can separate the jobs and working on them currently.
   - Although none of us were experts in Figma, we saw its potential to rapidly produce a polished demo.
3. **Structured Planning and Collaboration:**
   - Then, we quickly decided the workflow and identify key features that needed to be demonstrated. Then we divided the tasks according to member's interest and understanding.
   - Meanwhile, I reached out to a colleague with UX skills to give us with a short Figma tutorial, so that we can start working quickly and get technical support during development.

**Result:**

- Finally, our team successfully created an interactive Figma demo within the two-day deadline. And the presentation impressed our professors and other students.
- As a result, our project not only received high praise but also won the "Most Creative Design" award from our department.

**Lessons Learned:**
This experience reinforced that even under extreme time pressure, a structured plan and effective delegation are far more efficient than relying solely on intuition. It also taught me the importance of leveraging the right tools and external expertise to rapidly overcome obstacles and deliver outstanding results.

**Situation:**
During my junior year as an undergrad, I worked on a three-person team to develop a wearable navigation device designed to provide users with direction without distraction. This project involved both hardware and software development. We had to order various components from the website to build the project, so while we were busy developing the software, we were also waiting for the hardware to arrive. 

However, after completing and testing the software part, we found that the pandemic disrupted the deliveries, and many core components, even the motherboard, would not arrive on time. 

**Task:**

Due to our inexperience in real-world project management, I failed to consider the possibility that these devices might not be delivered on time, and we did not using a flexible schedule to handle the potential delays. We must take immediate action and make a corrective plan to mitigate the impact, cuz kept waiting will make all our previous efforts useless.

**Action:** 

1. **Immediate Assessment and Communication:**
   - Firstly, I immediately checked all existing and available devices in the lab and and compared them with our original plan.
   - We compiled this information into a report and immediately communicated the situation to our supervisor to seek approval for modifying our project goals and requested guidance for revising our timeline.
2. **Team Collaboration and Deep Analysis:**
   - While waiting for the approval, we carefully analyzed the gap between our initial plan and the current available resources.
   - Then, we assessed the remaining software work and discussed how to adapt it to the laboratory’s remaining platform. We also found that some features would need to be dropped due to hardware limitations.
3. **Developing and Implementing a Mitigation Strategy:**
   - After discussion and checking the revised project timeline, we decided to transfer our existing work to the available platform while only maintaining key features to achieve a minimum deliverable within the limited time.
   - Also, we re-designed several features according to limited device, and combined with algorithms to compensate for the low precision and simulated the feature, so that we could achieve similar functions under this condition.
4. 有啥改动
   1. Transfer from Raspberry Pi to Arduino, and using Python instead of C++;
   2. Initial design, we planned to using hi-precision GPS and map API to get the path, and using vibrator to indicate the direction.
      Now: Existing is not that advanced, and frequently lost its location. Also, we shift our target people to the disabled, whose daily routine were quite fixed. Therefore, we adopted fix paths for directions, and used acceleration sensor to count the steps and direction to judge whether the used was on the right track. 

**Result:**
Despite the setbacks, we successfully completed the project within the revised timeline. The final product, although limited in some features, was capable of providing non-disrupted navigation. Notably, we improved the device’s positioning precision under low signal conditions by ten times, and our solution also reduced the overall size of the device, enhancing its wearability.

**Situation:**
During the development of our **Online Snake Game & Leaderboard**, our six-member team encountered a significant conflict regarding the scoring mechanism. The data team was pushing for a **complex scoring system** to make the game more engaging and to capture richer data for analysis, while I advocated for a **simple scoring system** to ensure a quick launch to meet client's timeline and validate the game's feasibility. This disagreement was creating tension and delaying our progress.

**Task:**
Because we only have two developers and didn't want this disagreement to hinder our progress, We need to resolve the conflict and guide the team toward an agreement that balances technical feasibility with data requirement. And I needed to ensure that we delivered a working Minimum Viable Product (MVP) on time without compromising on quality or customer expectations.

**Action:**

1. **Clarified the Project Timeline:**
   - I reviewed our Gantt chart and overall timeline with the project manager, confirming that implementing a complex scoring system would risk missing our deadline.
2. **Facilitated Open Discussion:**
   - Then I organized a team meeting to allow everyone to share their opinions and concerns. I actively listened to the data team, recognizing the importance of a timely launch while also understanding the their desire to perform advanced analysis and enhance gameplay.
3. **Proposed a Balanced Solution:**
   - To ensure we met our deadline, I proposed implementing a simple scoring system for the initial release. At the same time, I addressed concerns about future enhancements by applying object-oriented design principles and the design pattern. So that the it can easily support advanced scoring features—such as difficulty-based bonuses—in the future.
4. **Validated with User Feedback:**
   - To ensure our approach was aligned with user preferences and not affect the project timeline, the data team also conducted a brief user survey about the gameplay at the same time. This data-driven step can help to design the advanced mechanism and support fast implementation in the future. 

**Result:**

- **Timely Launch:** As a result, We successfully implemented the simple scoring system and launched the game with smooth gameplay, on schedule, while leaving room for future enhancements. 
- **Foundation for Future Updates:** And the advanced scoring mechanism designed after the survey was quickly implemented because the data team setup a clear plan and the room for future update in the code.
- **Improved Team Collaboration:** Also, this experience strengthened trust and cohesion within the team, as members saw that their concerns were heard and balanced against the project’s core objectives.

**Reflection:**
This experience taught me three key lessons:

1. **Focus on Core Goals:** Prioritizing a timely, high-quality launch is critical—even when team opinions diverge.
2. **Design for Flexibility:** Building extensible systems from the outset enables future enhancements without major overhauls.
3. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Incorporating user feedback can validate our approach and help align divergent team goals.

### 8. 麻烦的顾客

**Situation:**
During my final year project, I was tasked with developing a machine learning solution to analyze 3D microscope images. The goal was to save research scientists several hours of manual classification. I successfully built, trained, and demonstrated the model, showcasing its ability to meet the project's goal.

**Challenge:**
It was at a final presentation. ASI was presenting the project, one client remarked that the this work did not meet his expectations because he thought it was not an App. He believed that current deliverable didn't meet the goal yet, which made me feel nervous and embarrassed, especially in front of the audience. But I quickly realized that The client may not be familiar enough with the GOAL of the project.

**Action:**
To address the situation, 

1. **Customer Obsession & Earn Trust:**
   I didn't point out his misunderstanding towards project. Instead, I calmly explained that due to time constraints, the presentation was mainly focus on the ML workflow and its core principles. But also, I can tell the basic usage process if time permitted.
2. **Ownership & Bias for Action:**
   After the presentation, I made a discussion with the client and clarified that our contract specifically required the delivery of a working ML model—not a developed application. After listening his understanding of ML method, which he thought was similar to his software used in lab, I took full responsibility for any miscommunication and also I offered a solution: if a complete software was needed, I would like to initiate a follow-up project to develop an application. Before that, I would automated the deployment with script and made a user manual for him for easy deployment and usage.

**Result:**
The client appreciated the my explanation and advice. He also understood the difference between ML method and Software and even apologized for the initial misunderstanding. Recognizing the potential of my work, we launched a new project that eventually led to a publication in BMC Biology and won an award. This experience also taught me the importance of clear communication and being patient and calm when interacting with the customer.

### 9. 解决问题后提升效率

**Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for the team** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速，每次开发完数据库相关的功能就会慢)

**Situation:**
During my internship as an SDE intern, we were building a partner matching platform based on a user system. We had successfully completed the user query function, and to test the system’s performance, we needed to simulate an environment with 10 million users. However, the existing data import process provided by the software was extremely slow. Considering that we would frequently repeat this process in the future, this could become a major bottleneck and hinder our development progress.

**Task:**
As a member of the backend team, I wanted to o optimize the data import process to ensure it wouldn't slow down our testing or future development. So, I am focused on looking into this problem, figuring out a better practice, and  them implemented this solutions that allow to quickly import data. 

**Action:**

+ Because the bulit-in function was too slow, so I decided to implement by my own. After I found that the bulit-in function do the insertion one by one, I first used Batch Insertion, which improved the speed greatly.
  However, I realized that if one of the loop insertion takes too long or fail, it would block or negatively impact the following batch insertions.

- To address this, I decided to threads to do batch insertion. The idea was to process multiple batches concurrently so that these can reduce the time.
  But it seems that the improvement didn't not meet the requirement.
- After analyzing and testing, I found that this issue came from thread pool configuration. I then using a custom thread pool to ensure each thread was active and performing the batch insertion.

**Result:**
The optimization resulted in a sixfold increase in data import speed. This substantial improvement not only resolved the immediate bottleneck but also accelerated our overall development and testing phases, making it easier for the team to simulate large datasets efficiently.
