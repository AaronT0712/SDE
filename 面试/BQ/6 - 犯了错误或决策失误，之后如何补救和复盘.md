### **6「犯了错误或决策失误，之后如何补救和复盘」**

​	•	**核心看点**：错误决策/执行 -> 造成的影响 -> 采取的补救措施 -> 反思/改进。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Are Right, A Lot**（并不总是对，错误的决策如何复盘与学习）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（你如何对利益相关者坦诚、挽回影响）

​	•	**Dive Deep**（如果你在纠错和复盘过程中用了深入的数据分析）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（如果你在有限时间内尽量把损失降到最低，也是一种“交付结果”）

**Situation:**
During my junior year as an undergraduate, I worked on a three-person team to develop a wearable navigation device designed to provide users with directional guidance without distraction. This project involved both hardware and software development. We had to order various components to build the device, so while we were busy developing the software, we were also waiting for the hardware to arrive. However, due to our inexperience in project management and procurement, I failed to account for the possibility that these critical devices might not be delivered on time, and we did not incorporate a flexible schedule to address potential delays. We were overly optimistic about the project.

**Task:**
After completing and testing the software, we encountered a major setback: the pandemic had disrupted deliveries, and many core components—such as sensors, the double module GPS, and most critically, the mainboard—were unavailable. This situation threatened to render our prior work useless because the available laboratory hardware was different from what we had planned for. As one of the developers, I needed to assess the situation, propose a corrective strategy, and work with the team to adjust our project goals to salvage the work we had already done.

**Action:**

1. **Immediate Assessment and Communication:**
   - I promptly inventoried all available devices in the laboratory and compared them with the components we had originally planned to use.
   - I compiled this information into a report and immediately communicated the situation to our supervisor. I sought approval to modify our project goals and requested guidance for revising our timeline.
2. **Team Collaboration and Deep Analysis:**
   - In several team meetings, we carefully analyzed the gap between our initial plan and the current available resources.
   - We assessed the remaining software work and discussed how to adapt it to the laboratory’s alternative platform. We also recognized that certain functionalities would need to be scaled back due to hardware limitations.
3. **Developing and Implementing a Mitigation Strategy:**
   - We decided to port our existing software to the alternative platform provided by the lab.
   - To mitigate the reduced functionality caused by the hardware differences, we opted to use algorithmic optimizations to compensate for potential precision loss.
   - We streamlined our project scope by eliminating non-essential features, thereby reducing our workload and ensuring that we could meet the new deadline with the resources at hand.
4. **Execution Under Pressure:**
   - With a revised plan in place, we reallocated tasks and adhered strictly to our new schedule.
   - Throughout the process, I maintained clear communication with our supervisor and the team, ensuring that everyone was updated on our progress and any further adjustments.

**Result:**
Despite the setbacks, we successfully completed the project within the revised timeline. The final product, although limited in some features, was capable of providing non-intrusive navigation. Notably, we improved the device’s positioning accuracy under low signal conditions by tenfold, and our solution also reduced the overall size of the device, enhancing its wearability.

**Lessons Learned:**
This experience taught me never to underestimate potential risks. I learned the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment, seeking guidance from experienced mentors, and maintaining open, honest communication with all stakeholders. The incident reinforced that proactive collaboration and a willingness to adapt are crucial when unforeseen challenges arise.

**Leadership Principles Demonstrated:**

- **Are Right, A Lot:** I critically reassessed our initial assumptions, learned from our oversight, and applied those insights to adjust our strategy.
- **Earn Trust:** By transparently reporting the challenges and involving both our supervisor and team in developing a new plan, I helped maintain confidence in our project despite the setbacks.
- **Dive Deep:** I conducted a detailed analysis of our available resources versus our initial requirements, ensuring that our revised plan was data-driven and realistic.
- **Deliver Results:** Even under severe constraints and unexpected challenges, our adaptive approach enabled us to deliver a functional product that met key project objectives.

在我本科大三的时候，我在一个三人组里准备制作可穿戴式导航的项目，我们想要制作一个用户不需要分心，就可以得知前进方向的小型设备。这是一个软硬件的项目，许多devices都需要订购，因此我们一边开发软件一边等待devices的到来。由于我们缺乏项目管理和设备订购的经验，我们在最初的风险评估和Schedule中，并没有给考虑设备无法到达的情况，也没有留有flexible timeline去解决突发的问题。我们太乐观了。

当我们已经初步完成软件部分，并做了测试以后，我们发现，因为pandemic造成的delivery问题，许多核心的设备，比如传感器，Double Module GPS，都没办法到达，最重要的是，运行的主板也没有货了，我们只能使用实验室现有的另一个平台，这表示我们前期的所有工作可能都是无用的，因为我们太过自信，对可能存在的风险忽视了。

作为开发者之一，我所做的并不是盲目等待或者感到沮丧和慌张，而是清点现有的以及实验室可以提供的设备，并将情况汇报给我们的supervisor，以寻求项目目标改变的许可，以及获取他对我们新schedule的指导。在清楚了已有设备的种类和数量之后，我们在组内开了几次会，经过多次讨论并平衡所剩时间和已有的软件成果，我们决定将已有的软件成果移植到新的平台，削减原先目标的部分功能来减少工作量，并决定利用算法优化来解决由于硬件缺失导致的精度缺失问题。

最后，我们成功地在剩余的时间内完成了项目。

尽管在功能上存在限制，但仍然能实现非侵入式的导航功能，且提升了10倍的低信号下的定位准确度。此外，我们的解决方法也缩小了设备面积，可以更好的穿戴在身上。

经过这次经历，我认识到，永远不要低估任何风险，不能依靠直觉而不调查项目的细节，而且，应该积极寻求Supervisor或有经验的人的建议，并积极反馈进度，依靠合作而不是单打独斗。
