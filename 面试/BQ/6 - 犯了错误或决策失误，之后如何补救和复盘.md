**Situation:**
During my junior year as an undergrad, I worked in a team of three to develop a wearable navigation device, which designed to provide users with direction without distraction. Because this project involved both hardware and software development and we had to order various components from the website. We started developing the software first, while waiting for the order. 

However, after completing and testing most part of software, we found that the pandemic disrupted the deliveries, and many core components, even the motherboard, would not arrive on time or even out of stocks. 

**Task:** 

Instead of waiting, I suggested we must take immediate action and make a corrective plan to mitigate this impact, cuz kept waiting may just let our efforts useless.

**Action:** 

1. **Immediate Assessment and Communication:**
   - Firstly, I immediately checked all existing and available devices in the lab. And we carefully analyzed the gap between our initial plan and the current available resources.
   - Then, we discussed possibility to move the software to the remain platform. We also found that some features would need to be dropped due to hardware limitations. Therefore, we narrowed down our target users from anyone to those who takes the similar routes every day.
2. **Team Collaboration and Deep Analysis:**
   - After that, we wrote a report about this situation, and discuss with our supervisor, to seek approval for modifying our project goals.
3. **Developing and Implementing a Mitigation Strategy:**
   - After getting the approval and checking our timeline, we decided to do the transfer while only maintaining the key features.
   - Also, we re-designed features according to limited device, and combined with Karman Filter Algorithm to compensate for the low precision and the unfinished feature, so that we could achieve similar functions under this condition.
4. 有啥改动
   1. Transfer from Raspberry Pi to Arduino, and using Python instead of C++;
   2. Initial design, we planned to using hi-precision GPS and map API to get the path, and using vibrator to indicate the direction.
      Now: Existing is not that advanced, and frequently lost its location. Also, we shift our target people to the disabled, whose daily routine were quite fixed. Therefore, we adopted fix paths for directions, and used acceleration sensor to count the steps and direction to judge whether the used was on the right track. 

**Result:**
Despite the setbacks, we successfully completed the project within the revised timeline. The final product, though cannot specify the path, was able to provide non-disrupted navigation. Moreover, we improved the device’s positioning precision under low signal conditions by 10 times, and the accuracy increased by 6 times by using the Karman Filter. We were satisfied with this outcome.

**Lessons Learned:**
This experience taught me never to underestimate potential risks. I learned the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment, seeking guidance from experienced mentors, and maintaining open, honest communication with all stakeholders. The incident reinforced that proactive collaboration and a willingness to adapt are crucial when unforeseen challenges arise.
