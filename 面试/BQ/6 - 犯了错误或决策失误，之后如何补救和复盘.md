### **6「犯了错误或决策失误，之后如何补救和复盘」**

​	•	**核心看点**：错误决策/执行 -> 造成的影响 -> 采取的补救措施 -> 反思/改进。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Are Right, A Lot**（并不总是对，错误的决策如何复盘与学习）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（你如何对利益相关者坦诚、挽回影响）

​	•	**Dive Deep**（如果你在纠错和复盘过程中用了深入的数据分析）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（如果你在有限时间内尽量把损失降到最低，也是一种“交付结果”）

**Situation:**
During my junior year as an undergrad, I worked on a three-person team to develop a wearable navigation device designed to provide users with direction without distraction. This project involved both hardware and software development. We had to order various components from the website to build the project, so while we were busy developing the software, we were also waiting for the hardware to arrive. 

However, after completing and testing the software part, we found that the pandemic disrupted the deliveries, and many core components, even the motherboard, would not arrive on time. 

**Task:**

Due to our inexperience in real-world project management, I failed to consider the possibility that these devices might not be delivered on time, and we did not using a flexible schedule to handle the potential delays. We must take immediate action and make a corrective plan to mitigate the impact, cuz kept waiting will make all our previous efforts useless.

**Action:** 

1. **Immediate Assessment and Communication:**
   - Firstly, I immediately checked all existing and available devices in the lab and and compared them with our original plan.
   - We compiled this information into a report and immediately communicated the situation to our supervisor to seek approval for modifying our project goals and requested guidance for revising our timeline.
2. **Team Collaboration and Deep Analysis:**
   - While waiting for the approval, we carefully analyzed the gap between our initial plan and the current available resources.
   - Then, we assessed the remaining software work and discussed how to adapt it to the laboratory’s remaining platform. We also found that some features would need to be dropped due to hardware limitations.
3. **Developing and Implementing a Mitigation Strategy:**
   - After discussion and checking the revised project timeline, we decided to transfer our existing work to the available platform while only maintaining key features to achieve a minimum deliverable within the limited time.
   - Also, we re-designed several features according to limited device, and combined with algorithms to compensate for the low precision and simulated the feature, so that we could achieve similar functions under this condition.
4. 有啥改动
   1. Transfer from Raspberry Pi to Arduino, and using Python instead of C++;
   2. Initial design, we planned to using hi-precision GPS and map API to get the path, and using vibrator to indicate the direction.
      Now: Existing is not that advanced, and frequently lost its location. Also, we shift our target people to the disabled, whose daily routine were quite fixed. Therefore, we adopted fix paths for directions, and used acceleration sensor to count the steps and direction to judge whether the used was on the right track. 

**Result:**
Despite the setbacks, we successfully completed the project within the revised timeline. The final product, although limited in some features, was capable of providing non-disrupted navigation. Notably, we improved the device’s positioning precision under low signal conditions by ten times, and our solution also reduced the overall size of the device, enhancing its wearability.



做方案评估

**Lessons Learned:**
This experience taught me never to underestimate potential risks. I learned the importance of conducting a thorough risk assessment, seeking guidance from experienced mentors, and maintaining open, honest communication with all stakeholders. The incident reinforced that proactive collaboration and a willingness to adapt are crucial when unforeseen challenges arise.

**Leadership Principles Demonstrated:**

- **Are Right, A Lot:** I critically reassessed our initial assumptions, learned from our oversight, and applied those insights to adjust our strategy.
- **Earn Trust:** By transparently reporting the challenges and involving both our supervisor and team in developing a new plan, I helped maintain confidence in our project despite the setbacks.
- **Dive Deep:** I conducted a detailed analysis of our available resources versus our initial requirements, ensuring that our revised plan was data-driven and realistic.
- **Deliver Results:** Even under severe constraints and unexpected challenges, our adaptive approach enabled us to deliver a functional product that met key project objectives.

在我本科大三的时候，我在一个三人组里准备制作可穿戴式导航的项目，我们想要制作一个用户不需要分心，就可以得知前进方向的小型设备。这是一个软硬件的项目，许多devices都需要订购，因此我们一边开发软件一边等待devices的到来。由于我们缺乏项目管理和设备订购的经验，我们在最初的风险评估和Schedule中，并没有给考虑设备无法到达的情况，也没有留有flexible timeline去解决突发的问题。我们太乐观了。

当我们已经初步完成软件部分，并做了测试以后，我们发现，因为pandemic造成的delivery问题，许多核心的设备，比如传感器，Double Module GPS，都没办法到达，最重要的是，运行的主板也没有货了，我们只能使用实验室现有的另一个平台，这表示我们前期的所有工作可能都是无用的，因为我们太过自信，对可能存在的风险忽视了。

作为开发者之一，我所做的并不是盲目等待或者感到沮丧和慌张，而是清点现有的以及实验室可以提供的设备，并将情况汇报给我们的supervisor，以寻求项目目标改变的许可，以及获取他对我们新schedule的指导。在清楚了已有设备的种类和数量之后，我们在组内开了几次会，经过多次讨论并平衡所剩时间和已有的软件成果，我们决定将已有的软件成果移植到新的平台，削减原先目标的部分功能来减少工作量，并决定利用算法优化来解决由于硬件缺失导致的精度缺失问题。

最后，我们成功地在剩余的时间内完成了项目。

尽管在功能上存在限制，但仍然能实现非侵入式的导航功能，且提升了10倍的低信号下的定位准确度。此外，我们的解决方法也缩小了设备面积，可以更好的穿戴在身上。

经过这次经历，我认识到，永远不要低估任何风险，不能依靠直觉而不调查项目的细节，而且，应该积极寻求Supervisor或有经验的人的建议，并积极反馈进度，依靠合作而不是单打独斗。
