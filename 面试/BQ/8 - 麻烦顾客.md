**Situation:**
During my final year project, I was tasked with developing a machine learning solution to analyze 3D microscope images. The goal was to save research scientists several hours of manual classification. I successfully built, trained, and demonstrated the model, showcasing its ability to meet the project's goal.

**Challenge:**
It was at a final presentation. ASI was presenting the project, one client remarked that the this work did not meet his expectations because he thought it was not an App. He believed that current deliverable didn't meet the goal yet, which made me feel nervous and embarrassed, especially in front of the audience. But I quickly realized that The client may not be familiar enough with the GOAL of the project.

**Action:**
To address the situation, 

1. **Customer Obsession & Earn Trust:**
   I didn't point out his misunderstanding towards project. Instead, I calmly explained that due to time constraints, the presentation was mainly focus on the ML workflow and its core principles. But also, I can tell the basic usage process if time permitted.
2. **Ownership & Bias for Action:**
   After the presentation, I made a discussion with the client and clarified that our contract specifically required the delivery of a working ML model—not a developed application. After listening his understanding of ML method, which he thought was similar to his software used in lab, I took full responsibility for any miscommunication and also I offered a solution: if a complete software was needed, I would like to initiate a follow-up project to develop an application. Before that, I would automated the deployment with script and made a user manual for him for easy deployment and usage.

**Result:**
The client appreciated the my explanation and advice. He also understood the difference between ML method and Software and even apologized for the initial misunderstanding. Recognizing the potential of my work, we launched a new project that eventually led to a publication in BMC Biology and won an award. This experience also taught me the importance of clear communication and being patient and calm when interacting with the customer.
