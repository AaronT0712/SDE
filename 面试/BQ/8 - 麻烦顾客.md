**Situation:**
During my final year project (FYP) at university, my lab requested that I use a machine learning approach to analyze microscope images so that they could avoid manual classification. The goal was to develop a process flow that automates image analysis, which was clearly defined in our project contract.

**Task:**
My task was to design, build, and train an ML model that could successfully analyze the images. However, during the presentation, one of the clients expressed dissatisfaction, saying that what I demonstrated did not look like the “tool” he expected.

**Action:**

1. Immediate Clarification:
   - In the meeting, I explained that due to time constraints, the demonstration focused on showcasing the ML process and model performance rather than a full-fledged GUI application.
2. Private Follow-Up:
   - After the presentation, I arranged a private conversation with the client to better understand his expectations and explain that the project was originally scoped to deliver an ML flow integrated into their existing software, not a standalone application.
3. Offering a Future Solution:
   - I further expressed my willingness to initiate a new project to develop a complete, user-friendly software tool if that was necessary, ensuring that the client’s needs could be met in the future.

**Result:**
The client apologized for the misunderstanding and acknowledged the potential of my project. As a result, we began discussions for a new project aimed at developing the complete tool he had in mind. This experience reinforced the importance of clear communication and aligning project expectations from the start.
