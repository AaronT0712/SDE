**Situation:**
In my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, our team was working an AI-driven project that provided personalized cosmetic and makeup recommendations. Two days before our scheduled presentation, one of the professor shows her interest and believed that our project had the potential to compete for the award. And our supervisor suggest we could have a more detailed presentation, but not just using poster.

**Task:**
Although the deadline was tight and our team only had four members, we were really excited and wanted to get the prize. So we decided to take supervisor's advice to improve our presentation.

**Action:**

1. **Rapid Assessment and Decision-Making:**
   1.  We immediately held a meeting to discuss about the form of presentation. Though we all agreed that an high-fidelity demo would make a great presentation, the limited time and lack of skills made it difficult to achieve within 2 days after evaluation. So, we decided to make a simple interactive demo while keeping the core features. 
   2. Then, we began to find a tool that, could help us achieve this goal within DDL.
2. **Leveraging the Right Tool:**
   - After a brief searching, we discovered Figma—a popular platform among UX designers for creating interactive prototypes—which also supports real-time collaboration, so that we can separate the jobs and working on them together.
   - Meanwhile, I reached out to a friend with UX skills to give us with a brief Figma tutorial, so that we can start working quickly and get technical support during development. Although none of us were experts in Figma, we saw its potential to rapidly produce a good demo.
3. **Structured Planning and Collaboration:**
   - Since we already have a poster version presentation, we quickly decided the process and key features that needed to be shown. After that, we divided the tasks according to member's interest and understanding, and then started to construct the demo.

**Result:**

- Finally, our team successfully created an interactive demo within two days. And the presentation impressed our professors and other students. As a result, our project not only received high praise but also the "Most Creative Design" award from our department.

  

**Lessons Learned:**
Under limited time, a structured plan and effective job allocation are very important. But, I would like to change the way we separate the task. We allocated the tasks according to our interest. However, this requires us to learn the entire process, which increased learning and communication cost. So, I would like to allocate the jobs according to functions. Everyone focus on a single implementation. This way, we could streamline the workflow and improve efficiency.
