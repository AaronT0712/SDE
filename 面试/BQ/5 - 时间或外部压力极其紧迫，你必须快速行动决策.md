### **5「时间或外部压力极其紧迫，你必须快速行动/决策」**

​	•	**核心看点**：突发紧急状况/极限期限 -> 快速抉择 -> 行动 -> 结果/教训。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Bias for Action**（在时间紧迫、信息不完全的情况下如何快速行动）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（高压力或临时突发下依然完成或超额完成目标）

​	•	**Are Right, A Lot**（如果当时信息不足，怎么权衡风险并做出正确决策）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（如果故事中有协调多个团队、赢得他们支持的过程）

**Situation:**
In my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, my team was developing an AI-driven application that provided personalized cosmetic and makeup recommendations. Two days before our scheduled presentation, other professors expressed strong interest in our work, and our supervisor suggest we should have a more detailed presentation, but not just using poster.

**Task:**
Although the deadline was tight and our team only had four members, we couldn’t afford to let the professors down. So we must quickly prepared an presentation that shows the key features within the given time.

**Action:**

1. **Rapid Assessment and Decision-Making:**
   1.  We immediately held a meeting about the form of presentation. Though we all agreed that an high-fidelity demo would make a great presentation, the the limited time and lack of skills made it difficult to achieve within 2 days after evaluation. So, we decided to make a simple interactive demo while keeping the core features. 
   2. Then, we began exploring tools that could help us achieve this goal under our DDL.
2. **Leveraging the Right Tool:**
   - After a brief searching, we discovered Figma—a popular platform among UX designers for creating interactive prototypes—which also supports real-time collaboration, so that we can separate the jobs and working on them currently.
   - Meanwhile, I reached out to a friend with UX skills to give us with a brief Figma tutorial, so that we can start working quickly and get technical support during development. Although none of us were experts in Figma, we saw its potential to rapidly produce a good demo.
3. **Structured Planning and Collaboration:**
   - Since we already have a poster version presentation, we quickly decided the workflow and key features that needed to be shown. Then we divided the tasks according to member's interest and understanding and then started to construct the demo.

**Result:**

- Finally, our team successfully created an interactive demo within two days. And the presentation impressed our professors and other students. As a result, our project not only received high praise but also the "Most Creative Design" award from our department.

  

**Lessons Learned:**
Under limited time, a structured plan and effective job allocation are very important. But, I would like to change the way we separate the task. We allocated the tasks according to our interest. However, this requires us to learn the entire process, which increased learning and communication cost. So, I would like to allocate the jobs according to functions. Everyone focus on a single implementation. This way, we could streamline the workflow and improve efficiency.

S：在我的HCI课程中，我们小组想要制作一款利用AI提供化妆品和妆容推荐的应用。在项目汇报前2天，我们的项目获得了老师们 的兴趣，他们告知我们小组，是否可以提供更加细致的产品演示。而不是如今的，在纸上画出的界面和演示。

T：尽管时间只有短短的2天而且我们组只有4个人，我们不能let customer down，所以我们接受了请求，并必须快速制定方案并实施。

A：由于只有我有前端经验，2天内完成整个前端界面是不现实的，但我们一致认为一个软件界面的演示会有更好的效果。于是我们分头寻找演示方式，终于我们发现Figma可以制作演示 （它被很多ux设计师用来制作软件的demo演示），而且它支持多人协作。

由于我们都对这个Figma不了解，我们决定将demo的制作进行分组。尽管时间有限，我们并没有直接开始工作，而是开会并确认整个应用的完整流程，以及必要的一致性问题，然后我们根据功能和流程来分类，将demo的制作合理的分给了每一个组员。同时，我又去寻求了其他具有UX经验的人的assistant，让她提供了一个快速的tutorial给我们组，这样也能加速我们的制作进度；

R：最终，我们的团队合作成功地在两天内制作了一个完整的Figma Demo，细致地进行了一个presentation。这个项目大获成功，还获得了 Most Creative Design award from our department。

L：从这里我更加确定了，就算时间再着急，一个简易计划和合理的分工，就算会消耗一部分时间，也比采用直觉，直接去执行更加的有效。
