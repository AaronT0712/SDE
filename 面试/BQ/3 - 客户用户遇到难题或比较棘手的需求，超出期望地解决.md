**Situation:**
While working on a project for a client from AMX, the clients were struggling with low categorization accuracy. Despite their attempts to improve the model by retraining it with different parameters, the results showed no significant improvement.

**Task:**
My responsibility was to determine why the translation accuracy remained low. I needed to understand the root cause of the issue by engaging with the client, reviewing their process, and collaborating with my team to identify and implement a solution—even if it meant suggesting changes that required extra time and budget.

**Action:**

1. **Engage and Understand:** I hold a brief but focused meeting with the client to walk through their entire process for producing the AI model. During this discussion, I carefully gathered information about their workflow and record potential areas of concern.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** After the meeting, I discussed the collected data with my team. Because the training parameters and processes appeared correct, we thought that the quality of the datasets might be the underlying issue.
3. 
   - **Validation Experiment:** To validate, We conducted an experiment by retraining the model using another, higher-quality dataset. This allowed us to test our hypothesis quickly without significantly delaying the project. And it proved our idea that dataset quality was likely the key factor impacting performance.
   - **Immediate Enhancement:** Recognizing that rebuilding the dataset would require extra budget and time, we decided to proposed another way to increase the accuracy. We found that client's model was developed based on BERT's model, so we decided to optimize the BERT and the clients could modify their models accordingly, which was more cost-efficient.
4. **Communicate Findings:** After optimization, We then organized a follow-up meeting with the client to present our analysis and optimization results. And we recommend clients could modify their models first, and improve their dataset in the future.

**Result:**
The client accepted our proposal. They felt that it would be difficult to rebuild the dataset due to limited budget, but the model optimization did address their short-term needs. Our solution not only resolved their immediate problem, but also set the stage for better model performance in the future.

**S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different parameters. But there was no significant improvement.

**T**：At that time, my Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. 因此我需要理解，客户的问题出现在哪里，并和我的团队一起找到解决方式。

我和客户开始了短暂的会议，go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything looks good. And I gathered the results and discussed them with my team. Then, we  realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. We should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

**A**：After diving deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly.

We put the results together and had a meeting to suggest the client that the dataset maybe the one of the severe problems that may affect the performance of Mode. And they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

**R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted our suggestions after reviewing the finding and will update their dataset in the future. Also, I introduced an extra layer for the error-prone classes and the accuracy increased by 13% without producing a new dataset. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also enable client could have a better training result in the future.
