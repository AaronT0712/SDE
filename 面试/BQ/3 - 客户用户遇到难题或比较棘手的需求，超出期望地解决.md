### **「客户/用户遇到难题或比较棘手的需求，超出期望地解决」**

​	•	**核心看点**：客户问题 -> 你如何理解、沟通 -> 你如何超预期完成 -> 效果与反思。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Customer Obsession**（几乎所有“客户互动”/“超出客户期望”的题）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（你如何让客户或团队对你产生信任？）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（如果故事包含你如何把客户反馈落地成结果）

​	•	**Bias for Action**（如果情境中客户问题紧急，需要迅速响应）

**Situation:**
While working on a project for AMX, the clients were struggling with low accuracy with their models. Though their tried to improve the performance by retraining it with different parameters, the results didn't show significant improvement.

**Task:**
As one of the Engineers, my job was to determine why the accuracy remained low after training, and find out the root cause, then collaborate with my team to identify and implement a solution for clients.

**Action:**

1. To better understand client's problem, I hold a brief but focused meeting with them to walk through their entire process for retraining that model. During this meeting, I carefully record their workflow and potential areas of concern.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** After the meeting, I discussed the collected data with the team. Because we found that the training parameters and processes seems correct, we thought that the quality of datasets might be the underlying issue but not the training itself.
3. 
   - **Validation Experiment:** To validate our idea, We made an experiment by retraining the model using a better dataset. This allowed us to examine our thought quickly without greatly delaying the project. And the result showed that dataset quality was the key factor in this issue. 
     Though we found the reason, we knew that building a new dataset with higher quality requires extra budget and time, and the clients may not pick this advice in a short time. We should find another solution for them.
   - **Immediate Enhancement:** Since the training was correct and the dataset should not be changed right now, we started with their model to find potential improvement. Because client's model was developed based on BERT's model, so we decided to optimize the BERT and then recommend this strategy to the clients as another solution, which was more cost-efficient.  
4. **Communicate Findings:** After optimization, the model accuracy increased by 13% without extra cost. We then organized a follow-up meeting with the client to present our analysis and two solutions. We recommended clients modify their models first, and improve their dataset in the future.

**Result:**
The client accepted our proposal. They thought our solution really exceeded their expectation, cuz it not only resolved their immediate problem with less price, but also set the stage for better model performance in the future.



需要数据，主动挖掘了为什么不用新的数据集

**S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different parameters. But there was no significant improvement.

**T**：At that time, my Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. 因此我需要理解，客户的问题出现在哪里，并和我的团队一起找到解决方式。

我和客户开始了短暂的会议，go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything looks good. And I gathered the results and discussed them with my team. Then, we  realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. We should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

**A**：After diving deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly.

We put the results together and had a meeting to suggest the client that the dataset maybe the one of the severe problems that may affect the performance of Mode. And they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

**R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted our suggestions after reviewing the finding and will update their dataset in the future. Also, I introduced an extra layer for the error-prone classes and the accuracy increased by 13% without producing a new dataset. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also enable client could have a better training result in the future.
