**「客户/用户遇到难题或比较棘手的需求，超出期望地解决」**

​	•	**核心看点**：客户问题 -> 你如何理解、沟通 -> 你如何超预期完成 -> 效果与反思。

​	•	**可覆盖的领导力题目**：

​	•	**Customer Obsession**（几乎所有“客户互动”/“超出客户期望”的题）

​	•	**Earn Trust**（你如何让客户或团队对你产生信任？）

​	•	**Deliver Results**（如果故事包含你如何把客户反馈落地成结果）

​	•	**Bias for Action**（如果情境中客户问题紧急，需要迅速响应）

**S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different parameters. But there was no significant improvement.

**T**：At that time, my Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. 因此我需要理解，客户的问题出现在哪里，并和我的团队一起找到解决方式。

我和客户开始了短暂的会议，go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything looks good. And I gathered the results and discussed them with my team. Then, we  realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. We should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

**A**：After diving deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly.

We put the results together and had a meeting to suggest the client that the dataset maybe the one of the severe problems that may affect the performance of Mode. And they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

**R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted our suggestions after reviewing the finding and will update their dataset in the future. Also, I introduced an extra layer for the error-prone classes and the accuracy increased by 13% without producing a new dataset. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also enable client could have a better training result in the future.
