**Situation:**
While working on a project for a client from AMX, I discovered that their machine translation system was producing low translation accuracy. Despite their attempts to improve the model by retraining it with different parameters, the results showed no significant improvement.

**Task:**
My responsibility was to determine why the translation accuracy remained low. I needed to understand the root cause of the issue by engaging with the client, reviewing their process, and collaborating with my team to identify and implement a solution—even if it meant suggesting changes that required extra time and budget.

**Action:**

1. **Engage and Understand:** I initiated a brief but focused meeting with the client to walk through their entire process for producing the AI model. During this discussion, I carefully gathered information about their workflow and pinpointed potential areas of concern.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** After the meeting, I discussed the collected data with my team. Although the training parameters and processes appeared correct, we hypothesized that the quality of the datasets might be the underlying issue.
3. Propose a Dual-Pronged Approach:
   - **Validation Experiment:** We conducted an experiment by concurrently retraining the model using an alternative, higher-quality dataset. This allowed us to test our hypothesis quickly without significantly delaying the project.
   - **Immediate Enhancement:** Recognizing that rebuilding the dataset would require extra budget and time, I introduced an additional processing layer targeting the error-prone classes. This innovation provided a near-term improvement while the client considered a long-term data overhaul.
4. **Communicate Findings:** I then organized a follow-up meeting with the client to present our analysis and experimental results. We demonstrated that the dataset quality was likely the key factor impacting performance, and our dual approach had led to a significant improvement.

**Result:**
The client accepted our recommendations after reviewing our findings. Although building a new dataset would require additional investment, they committed to updating it for sustained improvements. In the meantime, the extra processing layer I implemented resulted in a 13% increase in translation accuracy without needing a new dataset. This solution not only resolved the immediate problem but also set the stage for better model performance in the future.

**S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different parameters. But there was no significant improvement.

**T**：At that time, my Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. 因此我需要理解，客户的问题出现在哪里，并和我的团队一起找到解决方式。

我和客户开始了短暂的会议，go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything looks good. And I gathered the results and discussed them with my team. Then, we  realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. We should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

**A**：After diving deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly.

We put the results together and had a meeting to suggest the client that the dataset maybe the one of the severe problems that may affect the performance of Mode. And they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

**R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted our suggestions after reviewing the finding and will update their dataset in the future. Also, I introduced an extra layer for the error-prone classes and the accuracy increased by 13% without producing a new dataset. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also enable client could have a better training result in the future.
