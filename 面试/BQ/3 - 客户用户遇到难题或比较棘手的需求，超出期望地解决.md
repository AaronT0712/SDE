**Situation:**
While working on a project for AMX, the clients were struggling with low accuracy, which was over 75%, with their models. Though their tried to improve the performance by retraining it with different parameters, the results didn't show great improvement.

**Task:**
As one of the Engineers, my job was to determine why the accuracy remained low after training, and find out the root cause, then collaborate with my team to identify and implement a solution for clients.

**Action:**

1. To better understand client's problem, I hold a brief but focused meeting with them to walk through their entire process for retraining that model. During this meeting, I carefully record their workflow and potential areas of concern.
2. **Collaborative Analysis:** After the meeting, I discussed the collected data with the team. Because we found that the training parameters and processes seems correct, we assume that the quality of datasets might be the underlying issue but not the training itself.
3. 
   - **Validation Experiment:** To validate our idea, We made an experiment by retraining the model using a better dataset. This allowed us to examine our thought quickly without greatly delaying the project. And the result showed that dataset quality was the key factor in this issue. 
     Though we found the reason, we knew that improve or build a new dataset with higher quality requires extra budget and time, and the clients may not pick this advice in a short time. We should find another solution for them.
   - **Immediate Enhancement:** Since the training was correct and the dataset should not be changed right now, we started with their model to find potential improvement. Because client's model was developed based on BERT's model, so we decided to optimize the BERT and then recommend this strategy to the clients as another solution, which was more cost-efficient.  
4. **Communicate Findings:** After optimization, the model accuracy increased by 13% without extra cost. We then organized a follow-up meeting with the client to present our analysis and two solutions. We recommended clients modify their models first, and improve their dataset in the future.

**Result:**
The client accepted our proposal. They thought our solution really exceeded their expectation, cuz it not only resolved their immediate problem with less price, but also set the stage for better model performance in the future.
