**Situation:**

For my final year project, I was tasked with using machine learning to analyze 3D microscope images. By analyzed the distribution of protein, researchers can predict cell's life-cycle stage accordingly. Initially, because the lack of communication, I assumed that the core challenge was 3D image segmentation. I built a complex solution that using 3 dimensional method and several algorithms to ensure data consistency. However, during lab testing, I encountered several issues: differences in lab devices led to dependency problems, and most computers there didn't have a GPU, so the computational load made the analysis too slow.

**Task:**
I quickly realized that a practical, resource-efficient solution was necessary. My goal became to design a more efficient ML workflow that could run quickly on a variety of devices and still deliver accurate results, but not just assuming the ideal factors like the HW.

**Action:**

1. **Deep Dive & Research:** I conducted a thorough analysis of the available devices and the dataset. I reviewed relevant literature and consulted professors with AI expertise to understand the trade-offs.
2. **Resource-Conscious Redesign:** Considering the limited computing resource available, I shifted my strategy from full 3D segmentation to a hybrid approach—using 2D analysis combined with metadata restoration. This allowed for much faster processing on CPU-only systems while still capturing essential 3D information.
3. **Rapid Decision-Making & Automation:** I streamlined the entire configuration process with script to make deployment as simple as possible across different computers so that researchers can use them easily.

**Result:**
The redesigned ML solution ran successfully on multiple lab computers and achieved significant performance improvements with fast speed. This workflow not only deliver results under limited resource conditions, but it also generated more training data from a limited dataset. This innovative approach was well-received and won the prize, and eventually led to a publication in BMC Biology, which is one of the top science journal.

S：我的FYP，是使用ML解析3D显微镜图片。起初（沟通不足，这是实际项目而非理想的情况），我自然而然的认为，任务方向就是在于3维图像分割，这也是我刚开始的实现方向。除此之外，我还使用了复杂的算法，来维持数据一致性。但是最后在实验室测试时，实验室设备的差异产生的各种dependency问题无法运行，分析过程太过缓慢等问题。

T：我意识到，我需要开发一个实际的合理的方案，以允许它在大多数设备上可以较快的运行，而不是把所有条件都理想化。

A：我需要考虑有限的算力资源，去设计一个合理的ml方案。在和用户充分沟通，并调查了可用设备的情况后，我决定使用CPU可快速推理的算法，并且是可以跨平台使用的。在仔细分析数据集的信息，查看对应论文并咨询了与AI相关的教授以后，我通过二维分析+元数据复原的方式，实现快速的识别和数据计算。并自动化了配置过程，使得不同的机器都可以更加简易快速的使用。并且这个方式，可以获得在有限的数据集中，获得更多的训练数据。

R：最后，实验室的多个设备都能成功使用这个ML，并且效率获得了显著的提升。该项目的思路，也在后来写成了一篇论文，被BMC Biology decided.
