**Situation:**

For my final year project, which was using machine learning to analyze 3D microscope images. By analyzed the distribution of protein, researchers can predict cell's life-cycle stage accordingly. At the beginning, I assumed that the core challenge was 3D image segmentation so I decided to work based on this. I built a complex solution that using 3D ML method to analyze while using several algorithms to make the dataset consistent. This solution works quite well from my side. And it was over half of the project timeline, so I decided to deploy it to lab's devices for testing.

However, I found that differences in lab devices led to dependency problems and many of them cannot run this solution. And most computers didn't have a GPU, so it took several minutes to run and the accuracy was only less to 80%.

(用户体验：而且，我觉得现在的deployment was difficult for the researchers that don't have CS knowledge)

**Task:**
I quickly realized that 

​    (I failed to consider the real-world factors. It was not a coursework that under ideal situation, and now the computing resource was limited. I need to quickly adopt a new solution before the project completely fail.) 
​    (the computational resources were limited. Also, it seems that the dataset was not enough to perform a good training.) 
​    (the user experience was bad because of the difficult deployment and usage and long waiting time.)

So, my goal became to design a more resource-efficient ML workflow that could run quickly on various devices while still deliver accurate results within the given time.

**Action:**

1. **Deep Dive & Research:** Instead of rushing to work, I investigated of the available devices and the dataset in lab. Then I reviewed several literature and consulted professors with AI expertise to understand the trade-offs between computational-heavy method with accuracy. 
2. **Resource-Conscious Redesign:** Considering the limited computing and training resource, I shifted my strategy from fully 3D method to a hybrid approach—using 2D analysis combined with metadata for restoration. This allowed for much faster processing, even on CPU, while still capturing essential spatial information. Also, this process allowed me to have more training data from the limited dataset.



1. **Rapid Decision-Making & Automation:** Moreover, I communicated with the researcher and found that he nearly knew nothing about AI. So, I simplified the dependency configuration and made simple user manual so that researchers can use it easily.

**Result:**
The redesigned ML solution can run successfully on multiple lab computers in less than 2 seconds. And the average accuracy was over 90%. This project was delivered when the resources were limited. Moreover, this innovative approach  won the prize, and eventually led to a publication in BMC Biology, which is one of the top science journal.
