**Self-intro**

Hi, I am Yuhan,  recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Information Science from Cornell University, where I focus on backend software development, and machine learning. I was also the teaching assistant there. Before that, I earned the First Class Honors, Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, and won the Edgar Marchant Prize from the University of Liverpool in England.  Moreover, I got two papers decided. One was by the Conference and the other one was by the one of the top science journal as the second author.

After discovering my great interest in Software, I practiced a lot and gained hands-on experience in developing skills like Java and Spring Boot framework, Database like MySQL and Redis, Development tools like Docker, Git and also the front-end skill. Recently I am also learning about the AWS. Apart from that, I've completed several personal or team projects and internships, and the works included building scalable system, Microservices, RESTful APIs, and Optimizations. These experience also improved my collaboration and communication skills and adaptability. 



**Why Switching to Software?**
This started from my undergraduate experience. I'm a problem finder and love solving them. But I often found that the problems I wanted to tackle required software as a tool. For example, in my final year project, I built an AI that would have dramatically improved the efficiency of researchers, but in the end, they couldn't use it because I didn't know how to develop a desktop software for them. And the other experience is,  I am, I am not a bad person, I used to cracked the campus QR Code to enter the gate more easily, I mean without re-generating the QR code on the phone because the Winter was really cold, I am from the south by the way, but we didn't know how to put it on my phone and I just can generate it on my laptop, which was also inconvenient, and we eventually gave up.
Moreover, after studying software development a little bit, I realized that this is a field that improving efficiency and stability to serve others, and everyone strives to construct a great software to provide a better USER EXPERIENCE. And there also are a lot of interesting techiques in it, so I decided to make it as my career.



**Recent Project**

Recently I am working on an Online Coding Judgement System, you can think it as a really simplified LeetCode but maintaining core functions: user can sign up and login, they can browse problems, submit their code and get execution feedback. 

On the backend, I used the Spring Boot and MySQL as database. And now I am using Spring Cloud to split the system into different microservices to increase the scalability. For the front end, I used Vue3 with Arco Design framework, which made me more easy to build a basic user interface.

The core of this project is the code sandbox that I deploy it on the Docker and optimization for security and performance. For security, I rejected the unusual actions and execution code in the submitted file and manually specifying JVM's parameters to limit the usage of memory. And I decoupled the process of submitting code and get feedback by using Message Queue to improve the QPS.

Yeah. to conclude, I chose this project because of my interest in how Leetcode works and also I wanted to practise my front-end skills so that I can better understanding how the front-end and back-end works together, which is good for my personal growth I think.
