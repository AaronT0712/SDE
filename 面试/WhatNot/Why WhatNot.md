为什么是WhatNot

I would say because of the growing streaming selling market in the US and the potential of WhatNot.

1. I think WhatNot is one of the most successful streaming marketplaces in the US. You know I am from China, and you may be heard about the huge market about streaming selling there. And honestly, its been a daily routine of most people's life. And my brother is also a Live Streaming Seller.  But frankly speaking, there's not much streaming markets in the US except WhatNot. Although Amazon and TikTok has similar functions but it seems like they **don't pay much attention on it**. But WhatNot values it. The Biding Mechanism is really interesting, even me and my girlfriend felt a little bit addicted to it. 
2. Another reason is the potenial, I know that WhatNot got YCombinator's investment. And I also submit a project to the YC as a group and we successfully got an interview about out project with their CEO Garry Tan. Even though we failed in the end, YC's feedback showed me that a company that can get YC investment must have a detailed plan and great potential for growth. And I think WhatNot is a very promising company.
3. So I want to contribute to WhatNot's product to provide users with great experience, now and the future, cause I think this market has tremendous potential and keep growing in US. And I really want to be a part of it and grow with this company.



1. Yeah in short, the potential of market and company drives me to apply for a role in WhatNot.



别人产品有哪里不足？

For example, Amazon's streaming selling are mostly about recording but not live streaming. User cannot ask questions and get response in real time. Though Tiktok have streaming selling function, it seems that they haven't made it a Main Feature for the Tiktok, cuz many people found hard to find the streaming button in the app.



为什么这个岗位？

1. My experience and skills aligns with what WhatNot needs. For example, I have experience in building scalable software. During one of my intern, I implemented distributed sessions using Redis to increase scalability of the system. So that, company could add more data servers as users growing. And also I will make trade-offs when I doing a project or working. Such as balancing the performance and the available resources before selecting the final plan.
2. Moreover, I think have a good product instinct. During my graduate studying, one of my group projects "Makeup AI" , which provides makeup recommandation and virtual try-on, won the Most Creative Design award in our department. And You can also find the report on the Cornell website. 
3. The last reason is, I chose to be Software Engineer is because I want to provide solid, friendly software for the users. I think this is in line with WhatNot's philosophy of thinking of the users first.



WhatNot 有什么不足

I haven't dived too deep into this app yet, but I think the total experience is good and there are only several nice-to-have features but not drawbacks. For example, as the new user, I found it hard to decide which types are under my interest. Although I know WhatNot want to provide a better recommandation right after users register this App like X, I think it would be good to add the skip button. And the recommend according to user's actions. Another feature I think would be good is "Wandering". Just like how we interact with TikTok but with shopping live streaming. Image, if you go to the shopping mall, you probably will visit more stores and spend more times if you don't have any speific item to buy. Users may also find more interesting things that they never thought about before. And also, WhatNot can use proper algorithm to increase the exposure for the... I would say "no so famous sellers", so that people may more willing to stay on that platform to sell.



WhatNot最好的地方

I think the best part besides biding, it brings the customer and seller closer together. Different from traditional relationship between them, WhatNot brings a new shopping patterns that focus more on communication and people. I've seen, not just for once, customers will praise the sellers if this is their first trial in selling or they gave a good explaination about the items. This increased seller's confidence, and the customers can get what they want in a lower price. I think this is a win-win situation and I really like that.





1. What do you think is the most important, if working in WhatNot.
2. If I am lucky to get into the next round, when I will get the notification and when will the next interview coming?
