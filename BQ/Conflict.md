+ **Situation: **During my Year 2 project in UK(Junior year)

+ **Objective: **Build a navigation helmet based on Arduino, and user would be able to reach destination with GPS module.

+ **Details: ** We were in group of 3. At the begining of the project, everything was fine. We received several of components ordered a week ago and successfully deploy our initial code in our developing board. Though we met some difficulties in the circuit part, we still followed our plan and believed that we were in the right track.
  After receiving the essential components and assembling them together, we found that the geometic information was totally wrong. We showed the GPS data in a map and realized that it was flying around like bullets. After researching, we found that it was because the lack of GPS signal.

  One of my teammate said we should buy a more power GPS module. However, I didn't think this is feasible because of the potential logistic issue caused by the pandemic. My plan was utilizing the remaining accelerators in the lab and combine them with GPS together to get a more precise location data. But it was quite a challenge for us because we didn't got experience before and we didn't whether it could be finished before deadline.

  Three of us cannot decide which plan to perform though we didn't have much time, and we couldn't decide it. So I suggest that we should list the props and cons of each plan after evaluation in-group. Then we turn the evaluation to our advisor and other facilitors in our departments for advice and feasibility. Fortunately my plan works but it required further improvement.
