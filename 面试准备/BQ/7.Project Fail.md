## Project Fail

**Situation**: In my HCI Design course, I worked in a four-person team to design a smart makeup recommendation app using Figma. Our PM was supposed to communicate with our Project Advisor and update us on the feedback. We shared concerns with the PM about adding too many features, as we worried it could cause issues before the deadline. However, our PM reassured us that we were on track, so we continued adding complex features.

**Task**: I needed to ensure that we weren’t overcomplicating the prototype, but the PM kept telling us that the advisor was happy and didn’t share any concerns. As we approached the deadline, I noticed flaws in the prototype and suspected that the advisor hadn’t been properly informed about our progress.

**Action**: I decided to meet directly with the advisor, and I discovered that the advisor had raised concerns about our project’s complexity and the number of features. However, the PM hadn’t shared this feedback with us. After realizing the scope was too broad, I informed the team, and we tried to simplify the prototype. I led efforts to refocus on the core functionality, but it was too late to fully recover before the deadline.

**Result**: Despite our last-minute changes, the project ultimately failed due to the number of bugs and overly complicated features that were still in the prototype. 

**Learn**：However, this experience taught me an important lesson about the importance of communication and transparency within the team. I learned to trust my instincts when something feels off and not rely solely on a single point of communication. Moving forward, I always make sure to have direct access to critical feedback and encourage open communication to avoid similar issues in the future.
