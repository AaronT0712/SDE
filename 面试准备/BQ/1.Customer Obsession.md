## Positive (STAR)

1. **Tell me a time when you made a suggestion for clients** (数据集有问题，让它们换，可是需要钱&精力，我做好实验，整理证据，最后他们同意)

   **S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different **Existing** Datasets. But there was no significant improvement.

   **T**：My Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. After discussing with my team,  I realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. I should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

   **A**：I set up a **meeting** with the client to go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything seemed fine at first glance. But when I dived deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly and I put together my results and suggested to the client that they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

   **R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted my suggestions after reviewing my finding. As a result, the accuracy of their new model **improved by 200%**. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also gave the client a better way to develop their AI models in the future.

2. **Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for customers** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速，每次开发完数据库相关的功能就会慢)

   **S**：During one of my internships as an SDE intern, we were working on building a partner matching platform base on a legacy user system. After completing the user query function, we wanted to simulate an environment with 10 million users to test the performance. However, the way they import data into the database really took a long time, which would definitely impact our development progress.
   **T**：My job was to handle some of the backend development and optimize the system’s performance. So, I needed to resolve the slow data import issue to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck in our testing and further development.
   **A**：First, I moved the data import functionality into the test package so that it could be easily invoked as needed. After reviewing the existing code for importing data, I noticed that it established too many database connections, which was time-consuming. Additionally, the data import was handled through a `for` loop, which is linear and may lead to blocking issues. To address this, I implemented concurrent batch insertion using custom thread pools and `CompletableFuture`, which allowing us to insert data in parallel.
   **R**：The optimization was substantial—the data import speed increased by 6 times. This not only resolved the immediate pain point but also accelerated our development and testing phases.

## Negative (STARL)

1. **Describe a difficult interaction you had with your client.** (FYP, 客户想要工具，我做了个flow)

​	**S**：本科的FYP

​	**T**：实验室让我用ML方法，去对显微镜图像做分析，这样他们可以不用手动分类，节省时间。

​	**A**：我最终完成了目标，我构筑了Model并实现，训练之后，使用它可以成功地分析图片。但是在展示日的时候，其中一个client说这看上去不像他想要的，它不是一个tools。 

这很awkward，当着这么多人。我意识到他们想要application，但是这和我们contract写的不同；

1. 我不想让他们awkward，我说因为时间原因，pre的内容主要就是ML的整个流程，GUI界面不是展示的核心；

2. 私下交谈，跟他们合理的解释，ML method不是应用，尽管它集成在了他们常见的软件之中；
3. 如果他们还是需要，我也愿意开展新的一个项目，制作出完整的软件供实验室使用

​	**R**：他们向我道歉，并且认为我的项目非常有潜力，他们和我开展了新的一个项目。

​	**L**：1. 如果发现客户的目标和他们所想的不一致，不要推卸责任。在给客户解释清楚之后，可以继续寻求合作的可能性。

​		2. 此外，如果客户对专业领域不太了解，需要更多地去交流，带他们了解专业的术语，保证我们有一致的目标；

2. **Tell me a time when you made a suggestion for clients**

​	**S：**大学本科的毕业项目，Bio-Lab需要我用ML的方法，去对显微镜图像的细胞，根据生长阶段分类；这样他们就不用手动分类，能够节省大量的时间，提高效率；

​	**T：**我需要去根据他们提供的资料，去寻找合适的ML方法，实现，训练，并实现这个目标。

​	**A：**我最终在PyCharm里完成了这个模型，并且它有良好的表现。但我发现，很多实验室人员对于代码不熟悉，他们可能会感到困惑。而且它部署困难 (配置环境，安装dependency)，且容易出错。

最后，我决定做一个 基于Qt的可视化App，研究人员可以轻松使用并且允许更换权重文件以提高复用性。

​	**R：**最终，我的项目十分出色的完成了需求，还给他们简化了使用方式。所以我获得了学校给我的Prize
