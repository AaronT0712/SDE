## Positive (STAR)

1. **Tell me a time when you made a suggestion for clients** (数据集有问题，让它们换)

   **S**：While we working on a project for the clients from AMX, the clients were struggling with **low translation accuracy** and they had tried **retraining** their models with different **Existing** Datasets. But there was no significant improvement.

   **T**：My Task was to **figure out why the accuracy was still low**. After discussing with my team,  I realized that the issue might not be with the training itself but possibly with the **quality of the datasets** being used. I should suggest them to **get a new dataset** but it was time-consuming and **required extra budget**.

   **A**：I set up a **meeting** with the client to go over their process for producing the AI model. Everything seemed fine at first glance. But when I dived deeper into the datasets, I found several problems that could be impact the performance. To **validate** my idea,  I **worked** with my **team** to retrain the model using different, more reliable datasets concurrently to save time. The experiment shows that accuracy improved greatly and I put together my results and suggested to the client that they rebuild their dataset to get better results.

   **R**：Though building a new dataset requires extra budget, the clients accepted my suggestions after reviewing my finding. As a result, the accuracy of their new model **improved by 200%**. This not only fixed the immediate issue but also gave the client a better way to develop their AI models in the future.

2. **Tell me about a time you solved a pain point for customers** (for-loop导入太慢，concurrent + pool加速)

   **S**：During one of my internships as an SDE intern, we were working on building a partner matching platform base on a legacy user system. After completing the user query function, we wanted to simulate an environment with 10 million users to test the performance. However, the way they import data into the database really took a long time, which would definitely impact our development progress.
   **T**：My job was to handle some of the backend development and optimize the system’s performance. So, I needed to resolve the slow data import issue to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck in our testing and further development.
   **A**：First, I moved the data import functionality into the test package so that it could be easily invoked as needed. After reviewing the existing code for importing data, I noticed that it established too many database connections, which was time-consuming. Additionally, the data import was handled through a `for` loop, which is linear and may lead to blocking issues. To address this, I implemented concurrent batch insertion using custom thread pools and `CompletableFuture`, which allowing us to insert data in parallel.
   **R**：The optimization was substantial—the data import speed increased by 6 times. This not only resolved the immediate pain point but also accelerated our development and testing phases.

## Negative (STARL)

1. **Describe a difficult interaction you had with your client.** (FYP, 客户想要工具，我做了个flow)

​	**S**：

​	**T**：

​	**A**：

​	**R**：

​	**L**：

2. **Tell me a time when you made a suggestion for clients**

​	**S：**大学本科的毕业项目，Bio-Lab需要我用ML的方法，去对显微镜图像的细胞，根据生长阶段分类；这样他们可以节省大量的时间，提高效率；

​	**T：**我需要去根据他们提供的资料，去寻找合适的ML方法，实现，训练，并实现这个目标。

​	**A：**这也是我之前完成的，我最终在PyCharm里完成了这个模型，并且它有良好的表现。但我发现，很多实验室人员对于代码不熟悉，他们可能会感到困惑。而且它部署困难，且容易出错。我决定做一个 基于Qt的可视化App，研究人员可以轻松使用并且允许更换权重文件以提高复用性。

​	**R：**最终，我的项目十分出色的完成了需求，还给他们简化了使用方式。所以我获得了学校给我的Prize
