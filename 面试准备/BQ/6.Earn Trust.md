## 1. "Difficult Coworker" & Project Fail 偏向后者

**Situation:** In my **HCI Design** course, I worked in a diverse four-person team designing a smart makeup recommendation app using **Figma**. Our **PM** was responsible for communicating with the **Project Advisor** and keeping us updated. Although we were excited about implementing new features, I was concerned about whether we could meet the deadline without introducing too many bugs. The PM kept reassuring us that everything was fine, despite the growing complexity of our prototype.

**Task:** As the project progressed, I noticed that the features were getting overly complicated, and I suspected the PM wasn’t relaying important feedback from the advisor. I needed to ensure we focused on the core functionality to stay on track.

**Action:** I approached the PM multiple times to express my concerns, but they downplayed the risks. Realizing I couldn’t rely solely on the PM, I scheduled a direct meeting with the advisor. It turned out the advisor had raised concerns about the complexity and had advised us to simplify the prototype—a message the PM hadn’t shared. I communicated this to the team and led an effort to refocus on the essential features.

**Result:** Although we adjusted our approach, it was too late to fully recover, and the project ultimately failed due to the bugs and overly complex design. 

**Learn**：However, this experience taught me an important lesson about the importance of communication and transparency within the team. I learned to trust my instincts when something feels off and not rely solely on a single point of communication. Moving forward, I always make sure to have direct access to critical feedback and encourage open communication to avoid similar issues in the future.
