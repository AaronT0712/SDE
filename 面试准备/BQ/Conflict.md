## 关于Features的Conflicts

+ **Situation**: During the development of the *Online Snake Game & Leaderboard*, our team of six disagreed about the scoring algorithm. Some members wanted to implement a **simple scoring system**, where points were awarded for each food item consumed. I, along with a few others, proposed a **more complex scoring system** that would factor in player actions, time, and difficulty level to make the game more engaging and competitive.
+ **Task**: As the team lead, I needed to mediate the discussion and ensure that we came to a decision that balanced the technical feasibility with our project timeline, while also creating an engaging experience for players.
+ **Action**: I organized a meeting where everyone could share their views and concerns. To bridge the gap, I proposed starting with a simpler scoring system to meet deadlines but leaving room for future updates that could incorporate more dynamic elements, such as difficulty-based scoring and time bonuses. We also conducted a quick survey of potential users to gather feedback on which scoring approach they found more engaging.
+ **Result**: This compromise allowed us to complete the project on time with a solid foundation. The simpler scoring system was implemented successfully, and we received positive feedback from users. Additionally, we left flexibility in the code to easily introduce more complex features in later versions, keeping both the technical team and end users satisfied. This approach led to high user engagement with the leaderboard feature becoming one of the game’s highlights.
