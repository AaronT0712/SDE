## Tell me about a time when you were under a lot of pressure to meet a deadline. How did you handle it?

**Situation:** During my final year at the University of Liverpool, I was working on a machine learning project analyzing 3D microscopy images. This project required weekly progress reports and had strict deadlines. At the same time, I was preparing for the IELTS and GRE exams to apply for graduate programs, which were unfamiliar to me and demanded extensive study.

**Task:** I needed to deliver a high-quality project while also achieving high scores on these critical exams. Balancing both was essential for my academic and professional future, and the pressure was intense due to the tight timelines.

**Action:** To manage both the demanding project and my exam preparation, I created a detailed schedule that allocated specific time blocks for each task. I realized that studying for the exams was most effective in the early mornings when I was most alert, so I dedicated that time to IELTS and GRE preparation. Afternoons and evenings were reserved for working on my machine learning project because I found that my creativity was better. I used productivity techniques like the **Pomodoro Method** to maintain focus, working in 50-minute intervals with short breaks in between. Additionally, I communicated openly with my supervisor about my commitments and scheduled weekly meeting, which allowed us to set realistic expectations and adjust project milestones if necessary.

**Result:** By effectively managing my time and maintaining open communication, I met all my project deadlines. The project earned one of the highest grades and won the prize from our university, and will ready for publishing at a renowned Journal. Also, I achieved high scores on both the IELTS and GRE, contributing to my acceptance into the Masterâ€™s program at Cornell University.
