## Tell me about a time when you were under a lot of pressure to meet a deadline. How did you handle it?

**Situation:** During my final year at the University of Liverpool, I was working on a machine learning project analyzing 3D microscopy images. This project required weekly progress reports and had strict deadlines. At the same time, I was preparing for the IELTS and GRE exams to apply for graduate programs, which were unfamiliar to me and demanded extensive study.

**Task:** I needed to deliver a high-quality project while also achieving high scores on these critical exams. Balancing both was essential for my academic and professional future, and the pressure was intense due to the tight timelines.

**Action:** To manage both the demanding project and my exam preparation, I created a detailed schedule that allocated specific time blocks for each task. I realized that studying for the exams was most effective in the early mornings when I was most alert, so I dedicated that time to IELTS and GRE preparation. Afternoons and evenings were reserved for working on my machine learning project because I found that my creativity was better. I used productivity techniques like the **Pomodoro Method** to maintain focus, working in 50-minute intervals with short breaks in between. Additionally, I communicated openly with my supervisor about my commitments and scheduled weekly meeting, which allowed us to set realistic expectations and adjust project milestones if necessary.

**Result:** By effectively managing my time and maintaining open communication, I met all my project deadlines. The project earned one of the highest grades and won the prize from our university, and will ready for publishing at a renowned Journal. Also, I achieved high scores on both the IELTS and GRE, contributing to my acceptance into the Master’s program at Cornell University.

## **Give an example of a time when you took ownership of a project to deliver results.**

**Situation:** While working on a project with **American Express**, my team and I were tasked with improving the accuracy of a **BERT-based model** used for financial predictions. The model was initially prone to errors in certain data categories, affecting its reliability. **Although we analyzed and corrected issues in the dataset to enhance the model’s accuracy, the performance improvement was limited and fell short of the client’s needs.**

**Task:** Realizing that dataset corrections alone weren’t sufficient, we needed to find a more effective solution to significantly boost the model’s performance within a tight project timeframe. Given the complexity and time constraints, the initial expectations for substantial improvement were modest.

**Action:**  I **took the initiative** to delve deeper into the model’s behavior by analyzing its **internal activations**. Using tools like **Captum**, I visualized attention scores to identify where the model was misclassifying data. This analysis revealed specific patterns and weaknesses in handling certain categories.
Based on these insights, I proposed introducing a **Specialized Attention Layer** to give more focus to the problematic categories. Additionally, I suggested applying **Weighted Loss** to penalize misclassifications more heavily in those areas after discussing with the project advisors. I collaborated closely with the teams to implement these changes and fine-tune the model.

**Result:** As a result of these efforts, we achieved a **13% improvement** in model accuracy, far exceeding the initial expectations. This significant enhancement not only resolved the immediate issues but also provided the client with a more reliable predictive tool. Our success had a substantial positive impact on the project’s outcome and was highly appreciated by both the team and stakeholders.
