## 关于Features的Conflicts

+ **Situation**: During the development of the *Online Snake Game & Leaderboard*, our team of six disagreed about the scoring algorithm. Me, along with a few others, proposed a **more simple scoring system** where points were awarded for each food item consumed. However, some members wanted to implement a **more complex gaming system** that would factor in player actions, time, and difficulty level to make the game more engaging and competitive. 

+ **Task**: As the development team lead, I needed to mediate the discussion and ensure that we came to a decision that balanced the technical feasibility with our project timeline, while also creating an engaging experience for players.

+ **Action**: I organized a meeting where everyone could share their views and concerns. To bridge the gap, I proposed **starting with a simpler scoring system** to meet deadlines but **leaving room for future** updates that could incorporate more dynamic elements, such as difficulty-based scoring and time bonuses.

  <u>*(Such as **OO Design**、 **Observer pattern**、To make it suitable for different gaming state. To develop more complex features, we can implement the interface or extend the base class：比如不同的food，我们定义他们的形状，对应的分数，以及他们的behavior)*</u> 

  We also **conducted a quick survey** of potential users to gather feedback on which scoring approach they found more engaging, and also made sure that we won't waste our time in developing non-useful features.

+ **Result**: This compromise allowed us to complete the project on time with a solid foundation. The simpler scoring system was implemented successfully, and we received positive feedback from users. Additionally, we left flexibility in the code to easily introduce more complex features in later versions, keeping both the technical team and end users satisfied. This approach led to high user engagement with the leaderboard feature becoming one of the game’s highlights.
