## 1. Tell me about a time you learned something completely new in a short amount of time.

**Situation**: During my final year in undergraduate, my project involved using machine learning (ML) to analyze 3D microscopy images and determine their life cycles. Since my major was in ECE, both biology and ML were completely new to me. When I first got the image data, I remember thinking, "What am I even looking at? Why are these images blinking? What is ML? Does a robot run it?" I quickly realized I had to learn these things fast to complete the project.

**Task**: I needed to figure out what knowledge was required, what steps I had to take, and how to gather the necessary information to keep the project on track.

**Action**: I started by self-studying the relevant biology concepts and reaching out to professors in the biology lab to understand and extract key information from the images. Simultaneously, I began learning about bioinformatics-related ML. I experimented with increasingly complex ML models and gradually understood the entire ML workflow. After gaining some experience, I built my own ML model and dataset using Python, handling everything from training and tuning to deployment. Since I had prior knowledge of multi-threading, I incorporated it into the project to further optimize performance.

**Result**: In the end, I completed the project and achieved results beyond my expectations. The final model reached 90% accuracy, and the workflow was **60 times faster** compared to traditional analysis methods. This project not only earned one of the highest grades that year but also won a prize for my work. Even more exciting, a paper based on my project is set to be published in a bioinformatics journal this year. I believe this project is one of the best examples of my ability to learn and adapt quickly.
