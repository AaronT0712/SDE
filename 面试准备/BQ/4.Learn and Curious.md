## 1. Tell me about a time you learned something completely new in a short amount of time.

**Situation**: During my final year in undergraduate, my project involved using machine learning (ML) to analyze 3D microscopy images and determine their life cycles. Since my major was in ECE, both **biology and ML were completely new to me**. When I first got the image data, I remember thinking, "What am I looking at? Why are these images blinking?  ML? What is that? A robot that learns sth?" I quickly realized I had to learn these things fast to complete the project on time.

**Task**: From the **past experience** in studying, when I get something new to do, I needed to **figure out what knowledge was required**, what **steps I had to take**, and how to **gather the necessary information** so that I can keep the project on track.

**Action**: I started by **self-studying** the relevant biology concepts and **reaching out to professors** in the biology lab to understand these cells and extract key information from the images. Also, I began learning about bioinformatics-related ML. I **experimented with various ML models from easy to complex**, and gradually understood the entire ML workflow. After gaining some experience, I **built my own** ML model and dataset, handling everything from training and tuning to deployment. Since I had **prior knowledge** of multi-threading, I incorporated it into the project to further optimize performance.

**Result**: In the end, I completed the project and achieved results beyond my expectations. The final model reached 90% accuracy, and the workflow was **60 times faster** compared to traditional analysis methods. This project not only became **one of the best projects** that year but also won a prize for my work. Even more exciting, a paper based on my project will published in a bioinformatics journal recently. I believe this project is one of the best examples of my ability to learn and adapt quickly.

## 2. Describe a time when you proactively sought out new information to solve a problem / Curiosity

**Situation**: While working on the AaronFlow project, I initially introduced a **MySQL row-level locking mechanism** to prevent multiple workers from processing the same tasks. However, as I scaled the system, this mechanism became a **bottleneck**.

**Task**: I was curious about why this locking mechanism, which I thought should have solved the issue of worker competition, would cause performance problems. Also, I needed to find a better solution to handle the increasing number of workers without slowing down the system.

**Action**: First, I was really **interested** in why would this happen, so I **dove into the row-level locking mechanism** and discovered that in certain scenarios, it triggered **gap locking**, which locks more rows than necessary, causing contention among workers. I also realized that MySQL’s **deadlock detection** mechanism was on by default, which added great overhead as it performed time-consuming checks every time a new lock was introduced. (That's really interesting!)
To solve this, I began researching **distributed locking mechanisms** and found that **Redis distributed locks** could provide a better alternative. Although I had experience with Redis, I wasn’t familiar with implementing locking. After further research, I came across **Redisson**, so I took the initiative to understand its features and ran experiments under high-load conditions to validate its effectiveness in the AaronFlow.

**Result**: After integrating Redisson distributed locks, the system’s performance improved significantly. Also, This optimization allowed the system to scale efficiently, removing the bottleneck and ensuring consistent task processing across all workers, and positioned the system for future growth.
