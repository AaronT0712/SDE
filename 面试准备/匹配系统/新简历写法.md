• Implemented distributed sessions by using Redis to synchronize login states across distributed server clusters. Enabled single field modification by using Hash instead of JSON to store user information,  reducing memory by 20%.


• Reduced API response time from 1 second to 25 milliseconds by caching user information in Redis, ensuring data integrity with custom Redis serializers

• Achieved cache warming with Spring Scheduler, improving initial access speed by 97.7%

• Enhanced database write operations by using custom thread pools with CompletableFuture concurrency, reducing import time for 1 million rows from 300 seconds to 54 seconds.

• Implemented friend similarity matching based on the edit distance algorithm. Optimized matching speed from 34s to 7s.
• Enhanced concurrency control by implementing Redisson distributed locks to prevent duplicate team joining and exceeding team capacity, ensuring mutual exclusion and API idempotency.
