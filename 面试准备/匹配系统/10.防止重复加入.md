## 1. 为什么做这个功能

1. 在我测试他们的**加入队伍**功能时，发现：If I clicked the Join Button **repeatedly** in a short time, there would be an **extra** people in that group.
2. I realized that this problem may be caused by **Concurrency**, and quite similar to the **Cache Warming** that I've implemented. 

## 2. 实现过程

1. 刚开始使用 **Synchronized**，use `UserId` as Identifier, to make sure that there was **only one thread** execute the team joining.
1. But I realized that it would cause problem when we using **different servers**.
1. This problem was similar to the problem when i implemented **Cache Warming**.
1. 创建一个锁；所有线程抢夺；抢到的线程，执行完逻辑，释放锁；
