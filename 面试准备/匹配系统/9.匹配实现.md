## 1. 匹配功能的逻辑

1. What is **Edit Distance Algorithm**?
   Calculate the distance between two sequences (Strings or List). The distance is how many steps it takes to **convert** A to B;
2. 有没有更好的算法？
   **Cosine Similarity**, which is widely used in NLP. Calculate the **Cosine similarity** between two **vectors**. In this case, we can lower the weight of some tags such as School Name? Gender? to get more precise matching result.
3. 优化过程 (关日志，只选择需要的列，filter空tags。维护固定长度的list，而不是Map)
   1. At first, I took out all users, calculate their distance and store them into a **SortedMap**. Then pick the first lowest users as **List** and return. But it took nearly a minute to do so.
   2. I **closed** the log output. And in the **database**, I only selected the **columns we need** and filtered the users if they don't tags yet.
   3. And it just need several seconds.
   4. **But** I thought the map **took too much memory in JVM**, so I maintained a **fixed-size list** to store the **TopN** users (just like a **Monotonic** Stack)

## 2. 为什么不从redis来查找？

因为 Redis is **Single-Threaded**，如果用户数量很多，执行查询的时间就会很长，可能导致 Blocking；
