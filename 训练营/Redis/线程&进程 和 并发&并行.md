## 线程&进程 以及 并发&并行！

1. **Thread & Process**

   - **Thread** is the **basic unit** within the Process. They share the same resources(memory). 
   - **Process** is an **instance** of a program. They have **own resources**.
   - 运行两个浏览器：会创建两个 Processes;
   - 一个浏览器，打开多个网页，每个thread就会负责每个网页；

2. **Concurrency & Parallel**

   - Concurrency：一个时间内，几个事情**交替的执行**；

   - Parallel：一个时间内，几个事情**一起执行**；

     ```bash
     CPU (Single Core)
     +------------------------------------+
     | Task A | Task B | Task C | Task A  |  从左往右是不同的时间
     +------------------------------------+
     
     CPU (Multi-Core)
     +---------+---------+---------+
     | Core 1  | Core 2  | Core 3  | 从左往右是同一时间
     | Task A  | Task B  | Task C  |
     +---------+---------+---------+
     ```

3. **Relationship Between Threads, Processes, Concurrency, and Parallelism**

   + **Threads and Concurrency**: Using **multiple threads within a single process** can achieve concurrency. 
     For example, a web server might handle multiple client requests concurrently by using a separate thread for each request.
   + **Processes and Concurrency**: **Multiple processes** can also achieve concurrency. 
     For example, a computer running multiple applications concurrently.
   + **Threads and Parallelism**: On a **multi-core** processor, **multiple threads can run in parallel**, each on a **separate** core.
   + **Processes and Parallelism**: Similarly, **multiple processes can run in parallel** on a multi-core processor, each occupying a different core.
