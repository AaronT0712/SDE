## Distributed System （还有一点安全）

Dear Professor Birman,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is **Yuhan Tan**, and I am a **Master**'s student in **Information Science** at **Cornell University**. Currently, I am a **teaching assistant** for the course "Applied Machine Learning: Methods and Applications" and will be **graduating in December 2024**. I have been deeply impressed by your pioneering work in reliable distributed systems, particularly your contributions to cloud computing architectures and security protocols. Your innovative approaches to enhancing system reliability and security align closely with my professional interests.

Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I have accumulated experience in **distributed systems**. I **developed an** **asynchronous processing framework**, "AaronFlow", which features a two-layer architecture separating task scheduling from business logic. This design enhances scalability and efficiency, achieving a throughput improvement from 100 to 500 QPS. Additionally, I have implemented **distributed sessions** using Redis to synchronize login states across servers, reducing memory usage by 20%, during one of the internships. These projects have honed my skills in Java, Python, development frameworks and message queue. Also, such experiences sparked my interest in exploring the field of distributed systems.

I am writing to **inquire about potential research assistant opportunities** in your lab. With my technical proficiency in **Java**, **Python** and experience in **software development** and **machine learning**, I am confident in my ability and experience to contribute effectively to your research endeavors. I am particularly interested in supporting projects related to distributed system architectures and security protocols. (Recently I am developing a **Online Coding Judgement System**, as a simplified version of Leetcode, I used several ways to **ensure the security** of my code sandbox.)

Please find my CV attached for your consideration. Thank you for your time and for considering my inquiry. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I might contribute to your research.

Very sincerely,
Yuhan Tan
